《华尔街日报》和芝加哥大学全国民意研究中心（NORC）的一项最新民调显示，大约83%的受访者认为美国的经济状况糟糕或不景气。NORC是美国最大独立研究机构之一，该机构自1972年开始进行这项调查，此次调查的民众满意度跌至了最低水平。 ||| Roughly 83% of respondents said the state of the economy was poor or not so good, according to a new poll from the Wall Street Journal and NORC at the University of Chicago. That’s the highest dissatisfaction level since NORC—one of the largest independent research organizations in the US—began conducting the poll in 1972.
此外，超过三分之一的受访者对自身财务状况非常不满意。 ||| In addition, more than a third of respondents said they are not satisfied at all with their financial situation.
据《华尔街日报》报道，46%的受访者表示今年无法提高生活质量，38%的受访者称，他们的财务状况比过去几年更糟，这是自2008年全球金融危机爆发以来首次出现这种情况。 ||| Forty-six percent said they have no chance at improving their standard of living this year, and 38% said their financial situation is worse now than it was in the past few years—the first time since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008, according to WSJ’s reporting.
据《华尔街日报》报道，这项调查在今年5月份进行，对1000多名成年人展开了为期两周的随机抽样调查，误差率为正负4个百分点。 ||| The poll surveyed a random sampling of more than 1,000 adults over two full weeks in May, with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points, according to WSJ.
NORC公共事务和媒体研究副总裁珍妮弗·本茨向《华尔街日报》介绍了调查结果，她表示，高通胀是该调查结果背后的最主要原因。尽管美国的通胀率在连续七个月上涨后，在4月有所放缓，但消费者价格指数（CPI）同比上涨8.3%。3月份CPI同比增长8.5%，创1981年以来的最高纪录。 ||| Inflation is the biggest driving factor behind the poll’s results, according to NORC vice president of public affairs and media research Jennifer Benz, who spoke to WSJ about the survey’s findings. Though inflation slowed in April following seven months of consecutive gains, consumer prices jumped 8.3% from 12 months earlier. In March, the 8.5% year-over-year surge was the highest rate since 1981.
高利率持续给美国家庭带来经济压力。 ||| The high rates are continuing to put financial pressure on American households.
美国汽车协会数据显示，美国普通汽油平均价格持续攀升，达到每加仑4.87美元的历史新高。 ||| At $4.87, the national average price of a gallon of regular gas continues to rise to record highs, according to AAA.
今年3月专家对《财富》杂志表示，这一趋势可能会持续到夏天，预计未来几个月全美大部分地区的普通汽油价格将超过5美元，这可能迫使更多美国人削减开支。 ||| In March, experts told Fortune that the trend will likely continue into the summer, with prices expected to surpass $5 across a large part of the country over the next several months, potentially forcing more Americans to cut back on spending.
上周，美国总统拜登在《华尔街日报》的一篇专栏文章中表示，抗击通胀是其“首先考虑的经济问题”，并概述了他缓解高通胀问题的计划，包括降低日用品成本，减少联邦政府赤字，并允许美联储采取必要措施抑制物价飞涨，三管齐下应对通胀。 ||| Last week, Biden said in a WSJ op-ed that inflation is his “top economic priority” and outlined his plan to fix the issue—including a three-pronged plan aiming to lower the cost of everyday goods, reduce the national deficit, and allow the Federal Reserve to take the necessary steps to control soaring prices.
