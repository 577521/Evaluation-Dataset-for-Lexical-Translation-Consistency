全球管理咨询公司麦肯锡近日发布的报告指出，中国的下一波云迁移浪潮可能会由工业和制造业等关键领域来引领。中国的公有云市场规模有望在未来几年再增长一倍以上，从2021年的320亿美元增长到2025年的900亿美元。 ||| China's next wave of cloud migration is expected to be spearheaded by critical industrial and manufacturing sectors, and the country's public cloud market will more than double from $32 billion in 2021 to $90 billion by 2025, said global management consulting firm McKinsey& Company.
麦肯锡最新发布的报告称，虽然起步相对较晚，但中国在云计算的迁移速度上可谓突飞猛进，已然成为全球第二大市场。 ||| According to the latest report from McKinsey, despite a relatively late start, China has made enormous progress in terms of cloud migration speed and has become the world's second-largest cloud market.
未来几年，中国的云迁移速度将与世界其他地区基本保持一致，2021年至2025年间，将有19%的IT工作负载转向云端。 ||| Over the next few years, the speed of cloud migration in China will be broadly in line with the rest of the world, with a 19-percentage-point increase expected in IT workloads shifting to the cloud between 2021 and 2025.
但中国与其他国家与地区的区别在于其私有云占比很高，到2025年有望达到42%，届时公有云占比约为36%。 ||| However, China differs from other countries in its high proportion of private cloud, which is expected to reach 42 percent by 2025, compared with 36 percent for the public cloud.
麦肯锡调研显示，只有11%的受访企业计划以使用公有云为主。 ||| McKinsey's survey suggested that only 11 percent of the companies surveyed plan to be mostly on the public cloud.
其余受访企业将会继续搭配使用私有云与传统服务器，或者使用混合云。 ||| The remainder will continue to use a private cloud with traditional servers or use a hybrid cloud.
数字化转型与云采用是高度相关的。 ||| Cloud adoption is strongly correlated with digital transformation.
麦肯锡全球董事合伙人沈愷介绍说，“到2025年，中国78%的IT工作负载将在云上部署。” ||| "By 2025, 78 percent of all IT workloads will be on cloud in China," said Kai Shen, partner at McKinsey.
尽管如此，当我们仔细去看那些直接影响企业利润表的商业用例时，我们发现它们的云采用率是极低的，仅在0%到25%之间。 ||| But when we look across the cloud adoption of business use cases with P&L impact, we find that adoption rates are much lower at between 0 percent to 25 percent.
损益表（P&L）可以显示一个公司通过减少成本和费用，或增加销售来提升利润的能力。 ||| P&L is an indicator that can show a company's ability to increase its profit, either by reducing costs and expenses or increasing sales.
“这说明在开发、采用和扩大云计算用例方面，中国企业仍有巨大的机会。例如，动态定价和个性化、数字孪生和3D模拟、销售预测和库存优化”。 ||| "It demonstrates that Chinese companies still have enormous opportunities to develop, adopt and scale use of cloud, for example in dynamic pricing and personalization, digital twins and three-dimensional simulations, sales forecasting and inventory optimization."
报告还指出，从行业上看，许多行业拥有众多精通科技以及数字原生企业，诸如电商和教育行业，这些行业已将绝大多数IT工作负载转移到云端。 ||| In terms of industries, the report also pointed out that sectors with numerous tech-savvy and digital-native companies, such as e-commerce and education, have already shifted a significant portion of their IT workloads to the cloud in China.
但包括劳动力密集型的工业和制造业等其他领域还处于落后状态。 ||| Labor-intensive industrial and manufacturing sectors, on the contrary, have not done that.
在最新的国家政策引导下，这种情况很快就会改变。 ||| But that could quickly change given the latest national policy guidance.
