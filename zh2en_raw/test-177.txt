一项新分析结果显示，新冠疫苗本来可以在2021年1月至2022年4月间防止至少31.8万美国人死于新冠病毒。 ||| COVID-19 vaccines could have prevented at least 318,000 virus-related deaths between January 2021 and April 2022, a new analysis found.
布朗大学公共卫生学院、布莱根妇女医院、哈佛大学陈曾熙公共卫生学院和微软人工智能健康项目的研究人员进行的这项分析采用了来自美国疾病控制与预防中心和《纽约时报》的真实数据。 ||| The analysis used real-world data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and The New York Times and was done by researchers from Brown School of Public Health, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and Microsoft AI for Health.
他们的分析结果表明，自从新冠疫苗上市以来，死于新冠病毒的美国人至少“每两人中有一人”本可以通过接种疫苗避免死亡。 ||| Their findings suggest that at least "every second person" who died from COVID since vaccines became available might have been saved by getting the shot.
这一分析报告的合著者、布朗大学公共卫生学院卫生服务、政策与实践学副教授斯蒂芬妮·弗里德霍夫称：“在许多美国人都放弃接种疫苗的当下，这一令人触目惊心的数字提醒人们新冠疫苗对于抗击这一疫情的有效性。我们必须继续投入（资金和人力），让更多美国人接种疫苗和加强针，从而挽救更多生命。” ||| "At a time when many in the US have given up on vaccinations, these numbers are a stark reminder of the effectiveness of vaccines in fighting this pandemic," said Stefanie Friedhoff, associate professor of the practice in health services, policy and practice at the Brown University School of Public Health, and a co-author of the analysis. "We must continue to invest in getting more Americans vaccinated and boosted to save more lives."
尽管这一全国均值表明，近50%的死亡可以避免，但是研究人员表示，不同州之间存在很大差异，接种疫苗可避免的死亡人数比例从25%到74%不等。 ||| Although the national average indicated that approximately 50% of deaths were preventable, researchers said there were large differences among states -- ranging from 25% to 74% vaccine-preventable deaths.
西弗吉尼亚州、怀俄明州、田纳西州、肯塔基州和俄克拉荷马州是接种新冠疫苗可避免死亡人数最多的州，而一些疫苗接种率较高的州，比如华盛顿特区、马萨诸塞州、波多黎各州、佛蒙特州和夏威夷州，接种疫苗可避免的死亡人数是最少的。 ||| West Virginia, Wyoming, Tennessee, Kentucky and Oklahoma lead the list of states where the most lives could have been saved by COVID-19 vaccines, while states with higher vaccination rates, such as Washington, D.C., Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, Vermont and Hawaii, showed the lowest numbers of vaccine-preventable deaths.
哈佛大学陈曾熙公共卫生学院卫生政策和管理学助理教授、布莱根妇女医院外科医生托马斯·蔡说道：“这些强有力的数据描绘出美国50个州在新冠疫情期间的50种不同命运轨迹，强调了疫苗对于保护各州民众生命的重要作用。” ||| "This compelling data illustrates the trajectory of 50 states with 50 different fates during the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the important role of vaccines in protecting lives in each state," added Thomas Tsai, a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital and assistant professor in health policy and management at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
这项研究报告发布之际，美国新冠死亡人数刚刚超过100万。 ||| The study comes just as the nation surpasses 1 million lives confirmed lost to COVID-19.
白宫首席医学顾问安东尼·福奇博士上周在接受美国有线电视新闻网采访时表示：“作为一名科学家、医生和公共卫生官员，看到接种疫苗及加强针者和未接种疫苗者在住院率和死亡率之间差异的压倒性数据真的很痛心。两者之间发病率和死亡率的惊人差异就摆在你面前，100万条人命的代价啊。” ||| "It is really painful as a scientist, a physician and a public health official to see the overwhelming data that showed the difference between vaccinated versus unvaccinated and boosted when it comes to hospitalizations and deaths," Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House's chief medical adviser, said during an interview with CNN last week. "You have this disparity of morbidity and mortality, that staring you right in the face and it's amazing -- 1 million deaths."
美国疾病控制与预防中心的数据显示，迄今为止，已有逾2.2亿美国人完成了疫苗接种，其中有1亿人已接种了第一剂加强针。 ||| To date, more than 220 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, 100 million of whom have received their first COVID-19 booster, according to CDC data.
但是，符合接种条件的美国人中还有约9200万名（约占一半）还未接种第一剂加强针。 ||| However, about 92 million eligible Americans -- about half of those currently eligible -- have yet to receive their first booster shot.
福奇说：“当然，如果符合接种条件的人都能接种疫苗，我们本来可以避免至少几十万人死亡。我只希望人们能看看这些数据，并相信这些数据不是编造出来的，而是真实的。” ||| "Certainly, we could have prevented at least a few 100,000 of those deaths of people who were eligible to be vaccinated, gotten vaccinated," Fauci said. "I just wish people would look at the data and believe the data is not made up. It's real."
