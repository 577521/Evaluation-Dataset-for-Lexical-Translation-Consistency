在“一带一路”倡议下，中国向打造“小而美”项目的转型受到非洲专家好评。他们表示，这些项目将推动长期被忽视的非洲偏远地区的基础设施建设发展。 ||| A shift toward "small and beautiful" projects under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has been welcomed by African experts who say it will help the continent develop infrastructure in remote areas that have long been neglected.
随着中国越来越以建设-经营-转让和建设-拥有-经营-转让等模式为中心，来促进中非公私伙伴关系的利益，小型项目越来越受关注。 ||| The greater attention on smaller projects comes as China promotes the benefits of China-Africa public-private partnerships, centered on models such as build-operate-transfer and build-own-operate-transfer.

恩古尼说，大多数非洲国家经济主要依靠农业，需要更多的基础设施来实现生产现代化。 ||| Ngunyi said the economies of most African nations are based on agriculture and more infrastructure is required to modernize production.
恩古尼表示：“在这些地区，小型基础设施项目，如小型水电站、小型太阳能发电厂或小型灌溉水坝，有助于提高小型社区的产能，从而改善民众生活质量。” ||| "In such areas, small infrastructure projects such as small hydro, or small solar power generation plants, or small irrigation dams have the capacity to increase production in small communities and therefore transform the quality of lives of the people," he said.
