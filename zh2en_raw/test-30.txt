阳光照射1小时可为车辆增加约9公里行驶里程。 ||| Each hour in the sun will add up to nearly 9 kilometers of charge to the battery.
公司首席执行官兼联合创始人莱克斯·霍夫斯洛特在Lightyear 0车型发布会上表示：“电动汽车朝着正确方向迈出了一步，但它们依赖于电力，而电力仍然主要依赖于化石燃料能源。 ||| “Electric cars are a step in the right direction, but they are dependent on the grid, which is still dependent on mostly fossil fuel energy,” Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Lex Hoefsloot said at the reveal of the $263,000 Lightyear 0 model.
添加太阳能电池板，可以确保车辆能通过太阳能获得动力，并且可以减少车辆充电次数。”该车售价为26.3万美元（约合人民币176万元）。 ||| “Adding a new source, the sun, adds certainty that you will always have that charge and you will have to charge a lot less often.”
据Lightyear公司介绍，经过优化的太阳能车顶和整体设计可以使Lightyear 0在不充电的情况下行驶数周甚至数月。 ||| According to Lightyear the optimized solar roof and holistic design mean that the car can drive for weeks, even months, without charging.
按照每天约35公里的平均通勤距离，Lightyear 0在多云气候下最多可行驶两个月才需充电。 ||| In cloudy climates, based on the average commute of around 35 kilometers per day, the car can drive for up to two months before needing to be charged.
在阳光充足的国家，Lightyear 0的续航时间或长达7个月。Lightyear 0在接入普通家庭电源后充电1小时可行驶32公里。 ||| In sunnier countries, that could be up to seven months. Plugged into a regular home socket, Lightyear 0 can still charge 32 kilometers of range per hour.
Lightyear公司将于秋季开始生产，首批太阳能汽车将于11月交付车主。 ||| In fall Lightyear will start-up production, with the first cars reaching their drivers in November.
