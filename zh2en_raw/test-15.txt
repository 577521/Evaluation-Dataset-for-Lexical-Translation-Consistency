有报道称法国演员丹尼尔·奥图的奢华手表近日在意大利南部城市那不勒斯被偷，针对游客对于在景区失窃的担忧，那不勒斯的一名旅游业负责人想出了一个独一无二的解决方案。 ||| A tourism chief in Naples has come up with a unique solution for any visitors worried about theft in the southern Italian city, after reports the French actor Daniel Auteuil recently had his luxury watch stolen in the area.
旅行社联合会Aidit的主席切萨雷·福阿表示，酒店可以向佩戴贵重手表的游客提供廉价的塑料替代品，确保他们在外出游览城市时原物的安全。 ||| Cesare Foa, the president of the tour operators' association Aidit, says hotels could provide guests who wear expensive watches with cheap plastic alternatives to ensure that their actual timepieces can stay safe while they head out and explore the city.
意大利安莎通讯社上周报道称，奥图在乘坐出租车游览时，他手腕上佩戴的价值3.9万欧元（约合人民币28万元）的百达翡丽手表被两个骑摩托车的人从开着的车窗抢走。 ||| Italian news agency ANSA reported last week that Auteuil had a 39,000-euro ($41,250) Patek Philippe watch stolen from his wrist by two people riding scooters while he was traveling in a taxi with the window open.
福阿6月27日告诉美国有线电视新闻网说：“游客应该在那不勒斯享受宁静平和的时光，这很重要，因此酒店和联合会可以通过提供塑料手表来保证客人们感到安全和放松。” ||| Foa told CNN Monday: "It's important that tourists in Naples can enjoy tranquility and peace in the city, so hotels and the council could help to ensure that these guests feel safe and relaxed by giving them a plastic watch."
福阿还表示，这种塑料手表不仅可以有效地预防偷窃，而且还能作为独特的旅游纪念品。 ||| Foa went on to say that the suggested watches would not only be effective in preventing theft but could also double as unique souvenirs for tourists.
他说：“这种手表可以装饰得很精美，还可以印上坎帕尼亚区（首府为那不勒斯）的标志性图案，作为礼物馈赠亲朋好友。” ||| "The watches could be decorated, they could carry a symbol of Campania (the region in Italy of which Naples is the capital) on them and could be given as a gift to family members and friends," he said.
他补充道，那不勒斯“没有偷窃问题”，并表示那不勒斯和意大利的其他任何城市（比如米兰或罗马）或世界其他任何大城市没有什么不同，在这些地方游客和度假者通常都会被小偷盯上。 ||| He added that there was "no theft problem" in Naples and said that it is no different to any other city in Italy, such as Milan or Rome or, indeed, any other major city in the world -- where visitors and holidaymakers are often likely to be targeted by pickpockets.
福阿说，他建议的方案也很省钱，一块塑料手表的花费才只有10欧元（约合人民币70元）。 ||| Foa said that his suggestion for a solution would be a cost-effective one, too, as the plastic watches could cost as little as 10 euros ($10.58), he said.
当前还不清楚这一想法是否会付诸实施，但是，对于富有的游客而言，比起失去一块价值4.1万美元（约合人民币27万元）的手表，失去一块10.58美元的手表应该没那么心疼。 ||| Whether or not the idea will take off isn't yet clear -- but wealthy tourists may find it easier to part with a $10.58 watch than a $41,000 one.
