哈佛医学院临床讲师、执业医师、马萨诸塞州总医院健康生活方式项目研究和学术事务主任莫妮克·泰洛博士说，饥饿感的产生很复杂，可能有许多不同的诱因。 ||| Hunger is complicated and can have many different triggers, said Dr. Monique Tello, a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School, practicing physician and director of research and academic affairs for the healthy lifestyle program at Massachusetts General Hospital.
健康因素： ||| Medical reasons:
首先，排除健康问题，这点很重要。 ||| First, it’s important to rule out any medical issues.
泰洛说，如果一直感到非常饥饿，体重未增加或正在减轻，就应该去看医生。 ||| Anybody who is feeling very hungry all of the time and isn’t able to gain weight or is losing weight should see a doctor, Tello said.
可能导致持续或过度饥饿的情况（也称为多食症）包括： ||| Conditions that could cause constant or excessive hunger, also called polyphagia, include:
甲状腺功能亢进症：泰洛指出，当甲状腺过度活跃时，人体新陈代谢“加速”。 ||| Hyperthyroidism: When the thyroid is overactive, a person’s body and metabolism are “all revved up,” Tello noted.
除了饥饿，患者还会感到焦虑、颤抖，心跳可能会加快。 ||| Besides being hungry, patients feel jittery, shaky and their heart may be racing.
糖尿病：1型糖尿病患者缺乏合成胰岛素的能力，因此身体无法分解糖分。 ||| Diabetes: People with type 1 diabetes lose the ability to make insulin so their body can’t process sugar.
泰洛表示，“很多患者告诉我，他们不停地吃东西，但是却在掉秤，感觉很糟糕”。 ||| “They’re usually telling me: I’m eating and eating, I’m losing weight and I feel terrible,” Tello said.
下丘脑损伤：下丘脑帮助调节食欲和产生饱腹感。 ||| Damage to the hypothalamus: This part of the brain helps regulate feelings of appetite and satiety.
如果下丘脑因肿瘤或头部创伤而受损，可能会导致无法控制的饥饿感和下丘脑性肥胖。 ||| If it’s damaged because of a tumor or head trauma, it can cause uncontrollable hunger and hypothalamic obesity.
心理因素： ||| Psychological reasons:
如果没有生理问题，那么问题可能出在心理上。 ||| If there isn’t an underlying medical issue, the problem could be in the head.
考虑到人体消化系统的工作机制，每三到五个小时饿一次是合理的。 ||| It’s reasonable to be hungry every three to five hours given how the human digestive system works.
但电视上不断出现的食品广告和社交媒体上的美食诱惑会促使人们经常大快朵颐。 ||| But ever-present food marketing on TV and the constant stream of “food porn” on social media can trigger people to eat often and a lot.
泰洛说，还有根深蒂固的文化诱因，比如一日三餐加零食的观点。 ||| There are also deeply ingrained cultural triggers, like the idea of eating three meals a day plus snacks, Tello said.
她讨厌“神化早餐的重要性”——或者一起床就必须吃东西的观念。 ||| She hates the “myth of breakfast” — or the notion people have to eat as soon as they wake up.
泰洛说：“我告诉病人，‘你吃得越多，你就越想吃’。” ||| “I tell patients, ‘The more you eat, the more you want to eat,’” Tello said.
“人吃得越多，胃就越大。 ||| “The more people eat, the larger the stomach gets.
胃可以扩张以容纳大量的食物——这是一个可膨胀的器官。 ||| The stomach can stretch to accommodate large amounts of food — it’s a distensible organ.
如果胃是空的，就会释放饥饿信号。 ||| Then if it’s empty, it signals hunger.
如果你经常吃得太多，胃就会变大，那么你的胃一空，它就提醒你要吃东西，你会吃得更多。” ||| Well, if you’ve got a huge stomach from eating so much so often, the minute your stomach is empty, it’s signaling you to eat and you’re going to eat more.”
心态也会起作用。 ||| A person’s state of mind can play a role, too.
研究表明，压力会增加饥饿激素的水平，睡眠不足与饥饿激素水平升高有关。 ||| Stress can increase levels of ghrelin, research has shown, and being sleep deprived is associated with higher levels of the hunger hormone.
无聊、焦虑和抑郁也会让人在不太饿的时候想吃东西。 ||| Boredom, anxiety and depression can also send people looking into the refrigerator when they’re not truly hungry.
生活方式因素： ||| Lifestyle reasons:
有时候，对于“为什么我总是饿着肚子”这个问题，最简单的最佳答案是：你吃得太少，运动太多，或者两者兼而有之。 ||| Sometimes the best answer to the question “Why am I always hungry?” is the simplest one: You’re eating too little, exercising too much, or both.
解决对策： ||| Solutions:
不要让自己产生没有必要的饥饿感：少看电视和社交媒体上的美食。 ||| Don’t make yourself hungrier than you need to be: Limit your exposure to TV and social media.
泰洛说，试着跳过广告观看你最喜欢的节目。 ||| Try to watch your favorite shows without being exposed to advertising, Tello said.
老实说：问问自己，“我真的饿了吗？ ||| Get honest: Ask yourself, "Am I really hungry?
还是我很无聊？” ||| Or am I bored?"
如果你只无聊得想吃东西，那就要远离食物的诱惑。 ||| Remove yourself from any food temptations if it's the latter.
考虑间歇性禁食：这样可以让你重拾真实的生理饥饿感；更容易识别饱腹感。 ||| Consider intermittent fasting: It can reconnect you with true, biological hunger; make it easier to recognize feeling full.
通过调整饮食质量让自己更饱：避免白面包、烘焙食品和谷类食品中的精制碳水和糖。 ||| Feel fuller by adjusting the quality of your diet: Avoid processed carbohydrates and sugars found in foods like white bread, baked goods and cereal.
泰洛建议，饮食应以富含纤维、蛋白质和健康脂肪的饱腹饮食为主。 ||| Aim for a satiating diet higher in fiber, protein and healthy fats, Tello advised.
这样的选择会让你更容易产生饱腹感、饿得更慢。 ||| Such choices will keep you more satisfied, longer.
注意酒精摄入量：酒精会降低一个人的抑制力和自律性，这会让你吃得更多。 ||| Watch your alcohol intake: Alcohol lowers a person's inhibitions and self-discipline, which can make you eat more.
