为了清洁街道，瑞典马尔默市的新举措把“脏话”玩出了新高度。 ||| The Swedish city of Malmö is taking dirty talk to a whole new level in its latest effort to clean up the streets.
通过安装“会说话”的垃圾桶，马尔默政府希望更多人能把垃圾投放到垃圾桶里, 这种垃圾桶在“吃进”垃圾的时候会说“挑逗”的话。 ||| By installing talking garbage cans that dish out racy audio messages after being fed trash, authorities are hoping for an increase in rubbish being deposited.
马尔默市的大卫夏尔斯布隆桥上放置了两个这样的垃圾桶，行人只要将垃圾扔进其中一个垃圾桶，就会听到一个性感的女声的各种答复。 ||| Pedestrians that drop trash into one of two bins on the city's Davidshallsbron bridge are rewarded with extremely positive feedback from a sultry female voice, who offers a range of responses.
尽管用性感女声来吸引行人投放垃圾是一个新点子，但是能播放声音的垃圾桶在马尔默市并非头一回见。 ||| While the seductive approach is a fresh tactic, trash cans with voices are not a new addition to Sweden's third-largest city.

“请给垃圾桶喂食更多垃圾吧……没错，就像这样。” ||| "So please go ahead and feed the bins with more rubbish...yes, just like that."
长时间以来，马尔默一直负有环保生活先驱的盛名，所以这一最新创举也许并不让人惊讶。 ||| Malmö has long been renowned as a pioneer in eco-friendly living, so its latest innovation should perhaps come as no surprise.
