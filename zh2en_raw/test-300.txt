从装酒的容器到酒的价格，关于葡萄酒有很多老讲究。 ||| There are many stuffy rules about wine, from the type of container it should come in to how expensive it should be.
一个常见的误解是一瓶葡萄酒必须在开盖的当天喝完。 ||| One common myth is that a bottle of wine should be fully consumed the same day it's opened.
尽管一开盖酒就会开始氧化，但是没有必要因此独自干掉一整瓶，或者将剩余的葡萄酒倒进下水道。 ||| While it's true that vino does start to oxidize the moment the cork comes out, that's no reason to guzzle a liter of it all by yourself, or pour your leftover liquid down the drain.
据美食杂志《好胃口》称，只要储存方法得当，葡萄酒开盖后可以保鲜好几天。 ||| According to Bon Appétit, an open bottle of wine is still good for several days—as long as you know how to store it properly.
如果你打开一瓶新的赤霞珠红葡萄酒只是为了喝上一两杯，那么不要丢掉木塞。 ||| If you pop open a new bottle of cabernet just to have a glass or two, hold onto the cork.
几个世纪以来，木塞一直是红酒酿造流程的一个重要部分。 ||| Corks have been an important part of the wine-making process for centuries.
木塞材质的密度足以在不完全隔绝空气的情况下保持酒的新鲜。 ||| The material is dense enough to keep liquids fresh without sealing off air altogether.
瓶中有少量氧气可以让葡萄酒继续发酵，而氧气过多则会导致葡萄酒变得酸涩，口感不佳。 ||| A minimal amount of oxygen allows the flavors of the wine to continue to develop, while too much oxygen creates an acrid, unpleasant taste.
一旦你倒完酒，就要立即用木塞密封酒瓶，防止更多氧气进入瓶中酒。 ||| Once you've finished pouring your wine, squeeze the cork back into the bottle to prevent any more oxygen from reaching the drink.
如果你损坏或不小心扔掉了木塞，你可以用橡皮筋和铝箔包住一团保鲜膜作为瓶塞，或者用可重复使用的酒瓶塞。 ||| If you've damaged or accidentally tossed out your cork, a bit of plastic wrap with a rubber band, aluminum foil, or a reusable wine bottle stopper will work, too.
将开盖后的葡萄酒放在冰箱里，可以减少葡萄酒接触热和光等其他会导致葡萄酒变质的因素。 ||| Storing your opened wine in the fridge limits its exposure to other damaging elements like heat and light.
只要放在冰箱中，大多数红葡萄酒和白葡萄酒都可以保持2到5天不变味。 ||| Once it's refrigerated, most red and white wines will last two to five days before their flavors take a turn for the worse.
不过，起泡葡萄酒开盖后只有1到3天的保质期，有些天然起泡葡萄酒开盖后一天就变质了。 ||| Sparkling wines, however, have about one to three days before they're no longer drinkable, and some natural wines can go bad in a day.
超市卖的高单宁红葡萄酒通常开盖后保质期是最长的，最多可以保鲜7天。 ||| The highly tannic red wines available at the supermarket generally last the longest after being opened, with a lifespan of up to seven days.
由于不同的葡萄酒品种保质期差别很大，判断葡萄酒是否新鲜的最佳方式就是尝一尝。 ||| Because expiration dates vary so greatly between wine varieties, the best way to judge the freshness of what's in your bottle is to give it a taste.
过度氧化的葡萄酒口感不佳，但是试喝一口不会让你生病。 ||| Overly oxidized wine doesn't taste great, but drinking a test sip of it won't make you sick.
如果你实在不想喝可能变质的葡萄酒，你也可以通过外观和气味来判断它的品质。 ||| If you'd rather avoid drinking potentially spoiled wine, you can also judge its quality by sight and smell.
颜色转为褐色或散发出酸味的葡萄酒已经氧化了，这说明你该把它扔掉，再开一瓶新酒了。 ||| Wine that's developed a brown tint and/or a vinegary smell has oxidized, meaning it's time to toss it and open a fresh bottle.
