说实话这真的没什么用。 ||| Honestly, it’s not doing anything.
我们必须停止这场'新冠骗局'。 ||| We’ve got to stop with this COVID theater.
如果你们想戴口罩就戴着吧，但这太荒谬了”，德桑蒂斯说完深深叹息一声，并摇了摇头。 ||| So if you wanna wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous,” he said, letting out an audible sigh and shaking his head.

布朗表示：“我对他的语气感到有点意外。”他还称选择不摘口罩，是因为周围有很多没戴口罩的人，而布朗很担心会感染新冠。 ||| “I was a little bit surprised at his tone,” Brown said of the governor, adding that he chose to leave his mask on because there were many unmasked people around and he was wary of getting COVID-19.
布朗的父亲老凯文·布朗告诉美国全国广播公司旗下媒体WFLA-TV，他将建议德桑蒂斯“停止霸凌孩子”。 ||| Brown’s father, Kevin Brown Sr., told WFLA-TV that he would advise DeSantis to “stop bullying kids.”
