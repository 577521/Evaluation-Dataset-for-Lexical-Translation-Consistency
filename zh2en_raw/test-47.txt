中国财政部和税务总局上周宣布，对购置符合条件的乘用车减半征收车辆购置税，从而激励许多汽车制造商加大优惠力度以吸引顾客。 ||| China's finance and taxation authorities announced last week to halve the purchase tax of eligible vehicles, which has in turn spurred many automakers to increase their incentives in a bid to attract customers.
一名专家预计，今年汽车销量将比原预期多出200万台。 ||| As a result, 2 million more vehicles are expected to be sold this year than the previous estimate, an expert said.
为促进汽车消费，支持汽车产业发展，5月31日财政部和税务总局发布了减征部分乘用车购置税的公告。 ||| On Tuesday, the Ministry of Finance and the State Taxation Administration issued a notice on reducing the purchase tax of some passenger vehicles. The aim is to promote automobile consumption and support development of the automobile industry.
公告称，对购置日期在2022年6月1日至2022年12月31日期间内且单车价格（不含增值税）不超过30万元的2.0升及以下排量乘用车，减半征收车辆购置税。 ||| According to the notice, the vehicle purchase tax is halved for passenger cars with an engine displacement within 2 liters that are purchased between June 1 and Dec 31 and whose single vehicle price, excluding value-added tax, does not exceed 300,000 yuan ($45,000).
举购置一台价格30万元的2.0升排量乘用车为例，在购置税减半后，一位消费者可节省约1.3万元。如果购置一台20万元乘用车，购置税减半后可节省8850元。 ||| Taking a 2-liter vehicle priced at 300,000 yuan as an example, after halving the purchase tax, a customer can save about 13,000 yuan. If the purchase tax is halved for a 200,000 yuan vehicle, 8,850 yuan is saved.

这一举措有别于早前针对1.6升及以下排量新能源汽车和乘用车的车辆购置税优惠政策，业内人士认为此次的优惠力度很大。 ||| Differing from earlier preferential policies on vehicle purchase tax covering new energy vehicles and passenger cars with an engine displacement within 1.6 liters, the latest move is considered a great incentive by insiders.
