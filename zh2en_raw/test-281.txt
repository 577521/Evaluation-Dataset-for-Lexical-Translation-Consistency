丹麦广播纪录片《寻找自我》向美国中情局提出指控，称其在20世纪60年代初资助了一项针对311名丹麦儿童的实验。 ||| A Danish radio documentary series, The Search for Myself, did not hold back in leveling claims against the US Central Intelligence Agency that it had financially aided experiments on 311 Danish children in the early 1960s.
其中很多受试者是孤儿或领养儿童。 ||| A good number of them were orphans or adopted.
纪录片作者佩尔·温尼克就是其中一位受害者，他声称自己在哥本哈根市医院的地下室里接受了对其背景一无所知的测试。 ||| One such victim was the documentary maker Per Wennick, who claims that he was subjected to tests with no knowledge of their background in the basement of the Municipal Hospital in Copenhagen.
据称这些测试旨在研究遗传和环境因素在导致精神分裂症方面的联系。 ||| These tests were supposedly designed to investigate links between heredity and environmental factors in engendering schizophrenia.
在该实验中，主要研究目标是母亲患有精神分裂症的孩子。 ||| Of particular interest in the experiment in question were the children of schizophrenic mothers.
在311名儿童中，有207人的母亲有精神分裂，而其余人则没有，他们构成了对照组。 ||| Of the 311 children in question, 207 had such mothers, while the rest, who constituted the control group, did not.
温尼克属于后一组。 ||| Wennick was of the latter group.
与之前的类似实验一样，他在一无所知的情况下受到诱导。 ||| As with previous experiments of such ilk, Wennick received shallow enticements without information.
温尼克被许诺在哥本哈根市医院做一些有意思的事情。 ||| He was promised something exciting at the Municipal Hospital.
他还会因此得到16克朗。 ||| He would also get 16 kroner.
他坐在椅子上，戴着耳机，被人用言语、尖叫和噪音吓唬。 ||| He sat in a chair, had headphones placed upon him, and was subjected to statements, screams and noises designed to frighten.
他的身体上放置了电极，用来测量心率、体温和出汗量。 ||| Electrodes were placed upon his body, his heart rate, body temperature and sweat level were measured.
几乎可以肯定，温尼克参与的项目违反了1947年《纽伦堡法典》，该法典规定： ||| The program Wennick participated in was almost certainly a violation of the Nuremberg Code of 1947, which stipulates that:
“受试者的自愿同意绝对必要。” ||| "The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."
只有在该人具有法律行为能力、行使自由选择权，并且“对所涉主题的要素有充分了解和理解，以使他们能够做出清楚和明智的决定”的情况下，受试者的同意才合乎道德。 ||| Consent can only be ethically obtained where the person has the legal capacity to do so, has exercise of free power of choice, and has 'sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable them to make an understanding and enlightened decision'.
丹麦广播电台称，时任密歇根大学教授、美国心理学家扎诺夫·A·梅德尼克是该研究项目的幕后主脑。 ||| Danish Radio credited US psychologist Zarnoff A. Mednick, then a professor at the University of Michigan, with the idea behind the research project.
由于无法在美国找到合适的研究小组，他找到了哥本哈根市医院的丹麦教授菲尼·舒尔辛格。 ||| Unable to find a suitable study group in the US, he sought out Fini Schulsinger, a Danish professor at the Municipal Hospital.
他们在丹麦建立了长达数十年的跨国研究合作关系。 ||| Together, they established a decades-long Danish-US research collaboration on Danish soil.
据温尼克和国家档案馆称，该研究项目由美国卫生部门共同资助。 ||| According to Wennick and the National Archives, the research project was co-financed by the US health service.
此外，该项目还获得由中情局运作的人类生态基金的资助。 ||| Furthermore, it received funding from the Human Ecology Fund, operated on behalf of the CIA.
