在一项将46名新冠肺炎重症患者与460人的匹配对照组进行比较的研究中，研究人员发现，这些患者在感染新冠病毒6个月后受到的认知影响相当于衰老20年（从50岁到70岁），或智商降低10个点。 ||| In a study comparing 46 severe COVID-19 patients with 460 matched controls, researchers found the mental impacts of severe COVID-19 six months later can be the equivalent to aging 20 years – going from 50 to 70 years old – or losing 10 IQ points.
这种特殊的认知变化与早期痴呆症或常规衰老明显不同。 ||| The specific mental changes were also distinct to those seen in early dementia or general aging.
英国剑桥大学的神经科学家大卫·梅农是该研究论文的资深作者，他称：“神经系统疾病都会导致认知能力下降，包括痴呆，甚至是常规衰老也会如此，但我们看到的新冠病毒对认知能力的影响与所有这些有所不同。” ||| "Cognitive impairment is common to a wide range of neurological disorders, including dementia, and even routine aging, but the patterns we saw – the cognitive 'fingerprint' of COVID-19 – was distinct from all of these," says neuroscientist David Menon from the University of Cambridge in the UK, who was senior author of the study.
这项实验涉及46名在2020年3月至7月期间在剑桥阿登布鲁克医院接受治疗的新冠肺炎患者。 ||| The experiment involved 46 people who'd gone to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge as a result of COVID-19 between March and July 2020.
其中16人在住院期间使用了呼吸机。 ||| Sixteen of them were put on mechanical ventilation during their stay.
感染后平均六个月，研究人员使用测试工具Cognitron对他们进行监测，了解他们在记忆力、注意力、推理、焦虑、抑郁和创伤后应激障碍等方面的表现。 ||| An average of six months after their infection, researchers supervised them using a testing tool called Cognitron to see how they were doing in areas such as memory, attention, reasoning, as well as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
研究人员没有这些患者在感染新冠之前的检测结果可比较，于是退而求其次，将他们的检测结果与460人的匹配对照组进行比较。 ||| The researchers didn't have test results from before these individuals fell ill with COVID to compare to. Instead they did the next best thing, and compared their results against a matched control group of 460 people.
然后，根据66008名普通大众的情况，对这些结果进行测绘，看他们与自己所在年龄段的预期分数有多大偏差。 ||| These results were then mapped to see how far they deviated from expected scores for their age and demographic, based on 66,008 members of the general public.
结果显示，与普通人相比，这些患者的检测结果准确率更低，反应时间也更慢。 ||| The results showed that those who'd survived severe COVID were less accurate and had slower response times than the general public.
他们的认知能力丧失程度与从50岁到70岁的认知能力丧失程度相似，也相当于失去10个智商点。 ||| The magnitude of cognitive loss was similar to the effects of aging between 50 and 70 years of age – and equivalent to losing 10 IQ points.
好消息是，在后续的跟踪调查中，这些患者的认知能力有一些恢复的迹象，但最好的情况也只是逐步的。 ||| The somewhat good news is that, upon follow up, there were some signs of recovery – but it was gradual at best.
梅农称:“我们对一些感染新冠病毒后十个月的患者进行了随访，能够看到他们的认知能力有非常缓慢的改善。” ||| "We followed some patients up as late as ten months after their acute infection, so were able to see a very slow improvement," says Menon.
“虽然这在统计上并不显著，但至少正朝着正确的方向发展。不过，其中一些人很可能永远无法完全恢复。” ||| "While this was not statistically significant, it is at least heading in the right direction, but it is very possible that some of these individuals will never fully recover."
这项研究只研究了住院患者这种极端情况，但还有大量其他研究表明，即使是“轻微”病症也会造成类似的认知影响。 ||| This study only looked at the more extreme end of hospitalized patients, but there are plenty of other studies showing that even 'mild' cases can cause similar cognitive impacts.
目前尚不完全清楚新冠病毒为何以及如何导致认知能力下降。 ||| What's still not fully understood is why and how the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes this cognitive decline.
此前的研究表明，新冠肺炎症状严重时，大脑会减少额顶叶的葡萄糖消耗，额顶叶负责注意力、问题解决和工作记忆等功能。 ||| Previous research has shown that during severe COVID, the brain decreases glucose consumption in the frontoparietal network, which is involved in attention, problem solving, and working memory.
众所周知，新冠病毒会直接影响大脑。 ||| It's also known that the virus can directly affect the brain.
但研究人员认为，罪魁祸首可能不是感染病毒本身，而是多种因素的综合作用：包括大脑供氧或血液供应减少、静脉血栓以及轻微出血。 ||| But the researchers suggest the likely culprit isn't direct infection, but a combination of factors: including reduced oxygen or blood supply to the brain; clotting of vessels; and microscopic bleeds.
还有越来越多的证据表明，人体自身的免疫和炎症反应可能对大脑产生严重影响。 ||| There's also mounting evidence that the body's own immune and inflammatory response may be having a significant impact on the brain.
这项研究发表在《临床医学》上。 ||| The research has been published in eClinical Medicine.
