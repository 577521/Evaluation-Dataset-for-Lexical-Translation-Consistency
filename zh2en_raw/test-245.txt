正在进行的俄乌冲突带来了一些意外发现。 ||| The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to some unexpected discoveries.
俄罗斯媒体近日报道，美国在乌克兰资助了30多个生物实验室，那里储存着大量危险病毒。 ||| Russian media outlets recently reported that the Pentagon had commissioned more than 30 biological laboratories in Ukraine, where large quantities of dangerous viruses were stored.
据推测，美国依靠这些实验室开展生物战研究。 ||| The United States supposedly depends on these laboratories to implement its biological warfare research.
据报道，美国在全世界30多个国家共设有336个生物实验室，而乌克兰的实验室占了近十分之一。 ||| And these are only a handful, or less than 10 percent of the 336 biological laboratories the US reportedly controls in 30 countries around the world.
难怪美国极力推动"新冠病毒溯源"调查中国实验室泄漏病毒的可能。 ||| No wonder the US was desperately pushing for "origin-tracing" studies for the COVID-19 outbreak at Chinese laboratories.
也许是因为美国的实验室分布在世界各地，他们清楚病毒泄漏和引发大流行病的风险极高。 ||| Maybe because they have laboratories spread around the world, they are aware of the high risks of viruses leaking and triggering pandemics.
于是美国假设中国实验室也有类似的风险，但这种假设过于牵强。 ||| They assumed similar risks from Chinese laboratories, but that is stretching it too far.
美国自己“生病”了，却逼迫中国接受“治疗”。 ||| It is the US that's ill, but it is forcing China to take the pill.
这正是美国没能做好疫情防控的原因。 ||| And that's precisely why the US has failed to bring COVID-19 under control on its shores.
美国不是承认问题，而是忙于指责他人。 ||| Instead of acknowledging the problem it is busy blaming others.
为什么40年来美国一直试图阻止《禁止生物武器公约》建立核查机制，现在答案显而易见。 ||| It is now also clear why the US has, for four decades, tried to prevent the Biological Weapons Convention from establishing a checking mechanism.
在182个公约签署国中，美国是唯一一个在2001年退出核查机制谈判的国家。 ||| Of the 182 signatories to the convention, the US is the only one that pulled out of negotiations for such a mechanism in 2001.
很明显，美国这样做是为了保护其全球336个生物实验室的秘密。 ||| It is clear that by doing so the US wants to protect the secrets of its 336 biological labs worldwide.
最新报道称，美国驻乌克兰大使馆匆忙删除了乌克兰生物实验室的相关信息。 ||| Latest reports say that the US embassy in Ukraine hurriedly deleted information related to the biological labs there.
但他们无法抹去世界各地存在此类实验室的事实。 ||| But they cannot wash away the fact about the existence of such laboratories around the world.
现在是时候公布这些生物实验室的有关信息了，那里储存了什么样的病毒、正在进行什么“研究”，以及它们对所在国家和世界各地的人们造成了什么伤害。 ||| It is time the US published information about these biological laboratories, including what kind of viruses are stored there, what "research" is going on and what harm they pose to people in these countries and around the world.
世界应该要求答案。 ||| The world should demand answers.
