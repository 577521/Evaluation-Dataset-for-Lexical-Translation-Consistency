据圣何塞焦点网5月23日报道，枪支暴力事件每年导致美国加州北部的圣克拉拉县损失7200万美元（约合人民币4.8亿元）。 ||| Firearm incidents cost Santa Clara, a US county in Northern California, 72 million US dollars each year, according to a report by San Jose Spotlight on Monday.

该县的地区助理检察官詹姆斯·吉本斯-夏比骆还表示，枪击事件给该县各社区带来了比经济损失更加深远的影响。 ||| The county's Assistant District Attorney James Gibbons-Shapiro also said that shootings have impacts on communities throughout the county that go deeper than dollars.
