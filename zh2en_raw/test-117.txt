一家日本公司最近推出了一款白边牛奶面包，希望以此遏制在制作三明治时去掉面包边的行为。 ||| A Japanese company recently released a white crust milk bread that it hopes will curb the practice of removing the crust when making sandwiches.
你可知道，日本每天制作的牛奶面包三明治绝大多数都会去掉面包边？ ||| Did you know that the vast majority of milk bread sandwiches made daily in Japan have their crusts removed?
尽管也存在带面包边的三明治，但是大众普遍认为日式牛奶吐司松软的白色部分比棕色面包边更好吃。 ||| While crusted sandwiches do exist, the general perception is that the fluffy, white part of Japanese shokupan milk bread is tastier than the brown crust.
这一观念要追溯到很久以前，那时候面包边很硬，但现在情况大不相同了。 ||| This perception dates back to a time long ago when the crust was harder to chew through, but things are definitely a lot different today.
如今的面包边细腻柔软，但是人们似乎还是更喜欢去掉面包边的三明治。 ||| The crust is nice and soft, but people still seem to prefer crusted sandwiches.
结果就导致大量食物浪费，于是一家公司希望能通过新创的白边日式牛奶吐司来改变这一现状。 ||| That results in a lot of food waste, but one company hopes to change that with an innovative white crust shokupan bread.
东京主厨杉本和他在帝国酒店的团队花了6个月时间研制出一款新式面包，据称能免除去边的需要。 ||| Tokyo Chef Sugimoto and his team at the Imperial Hotel Co., Ltd. spent six months developing an innovative type of bread that they claim eliminates the need to get rid of the crust.
一直以来人们想出各种办法来回收面包边以遏制食物浪费，但是杉本的想法是制作出一款原本就不必丢弃的面包边。 ||| People have been coming up with all sorts of ways to recycle bread crusts in order to curb food waste, but Sugimoto’s idea was to create a crust that didn’t have to be discarded in the first place.
尽管帝国酒店没有完全公开这款新白边面包的秘方，但是提到了这款面包要文火慢烤，比常规的日式牛奶吐司烘烤温度更低，这样面包才能通体白色，质地更润。 ||| Although Imperial Hotel did not fully disclose the secret behind its new white crust bread, it did mention that it is baked slowly at a lower temperature than regular shokupan bread, which results in a white color all through the bread and a more moist texture.
由日本贵族创立于1890年的帝国酒店过去供应给顾客的都是去边牛奶面包三明治，但是从今年10月1日起，帝国酒店将改为供应这种新式白边面包，从而大幅减少食物浪费。 ||| Founded in 1890 by Japanese aristocracy, Imperial Hotel used to serve crustless milk bread sandwiches to its customers, but starting on October 1st of this year, they will be switching to this new white crust bread, thus decreasing its food waste considerably.
这款白边面包将在帝国酒店的餐厅里和宴会上供应，但是人们也可以从该酒店的高档面包房Gargantua Delicatessen购买，这家面包房从1971年营业至今。 ||| The white crust bread will be served in the Imperial Hotel’s restaurants and at banquets, but people will also be able to purchase it from Gargantua Delicatessen, a luxury bakery that has been operating since 1971.
