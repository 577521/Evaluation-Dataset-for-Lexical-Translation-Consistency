专营厨浴创新设备的日本“科学”科技公司近日宣布计划生产“人类洗澡机”。 ||| Science, a Japanese technology company specializing in bathroom and kitchen innovation, recently unveiled plans to produce a washing machine for humans.
信不信由你，人类洗澡机的概念并不新鲜。 ||| Believe it or not, the concept of a human washing machine isn’t new.
在1970年的大阪世博会上，日本电器巨头三洋电机公司展示了“超声波浴缸”，这款全自动人类洗澡机可以在15分钟的周期内对人体进行清洁、按摩和干燥。 ||| At the 1970 Osaka Expo, Japanese electronics giant Sanyo Electric showcased its ‘Ultrasonic Bath’, a human washing machine that cleaned, massaged, and dried the occupant in a fully-automated 15-minute cycle.
这一概念产品始终未被商业化，但如今另一家日本科技公司打算放手一试，并承诺在2025年前推出一款现代化的人类洗澡机。 ||| The concept never really took off as a commercial product, but now another Japanese technology company wants to take a shot at it, promising to deliver a modern take on the human washing machine by 2025.
以多款厨浴创新设备著称的总部在大阪的“科学”公司宣布计划打造自己的人类洗澡机版本。 ||| Osaka-based Science Co. Ltd., a company known for its many innovations in bath and kitchen technology, has announced its plans to create its own version of the human washing machine.
这一名为Usoyaro的工程采用了最新的微小泡沫技术，并安装了多种传感器和一套人工智能系统，意在打造丰富的沐浴体验。 ||| Named ‘Project Usoyaro’, the latest “fine bubble technology”, as well as a variety of monitoring sensors and an artificial intelligence system to produce a complex bath experience.
科学公司声称，Usoyaro工程的目标不仅是彻底清洁用户身体，还想通过舒缓的音乐和防水显示屏上播放的图像让用户放松，疗愈身心。 ||| Science has stated that the goal of Project Usoyaro is not solely to thoroughly clean the body of the user, but also to provide a healing space where you can relax and unwind to the sound of soothing music and the view of images displayed on a water-resistant display inside the machine.
洗澡机内的传感器将会感知用户的交感神经和副交感神经状态，内置智能系统会利用收集的数据来营造尽可能舒适的氛围。 ||| Sensors inside the washing machine will measure the state of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, and the built-in AI will use the collected data to create the most comfortable atmosphere possible.
Usoyaro工程显然是“科学”公司总裁青山保昭钟爱的项目。三洋的洗澡原型机在大阪亮相时他只有10岁。 ||| Project Usoyaro is apparently a pet project of Science Co. Ltd. chairman Yasuaki Aoyama, who was only 10 years old when Sanyo’s original human washing machine was unveiled in Osaka.
当时他对这一发明十分着迷，决定只要有机会就要加以改进。 ||| He was so fascinated by the invention that he decided to improve on it if he ever had the chance.
“科学”公司预期Usoyaro工程会在2024年前研制出实用的人类洗澡机，并希望能在2025年大阪世博会上展示。 ||| Science expects that Project Usoyaro will result in a functional human washing machine by 2024, which the company hopes to showcase at the 2025 Osaka Expo.
