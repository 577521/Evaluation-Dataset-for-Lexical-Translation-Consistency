奥林匹克转播服务公司首席执行官兼奥运频道执行董事伊阿尼斯·埃克萨科斯称，2022北京冬季奥运会开幕式将与2008北京夏季奥运会开幕式“截然不同”，但是会“同样震撼”。 ||| The opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics will be "very different" from that of the 2008 Summer Games but will be "equally impressive," according to Yiannis Exarchos, CEO of Olympic Broadcasting Services.
埃克萨科斯在观看完彩排后对这场开幕式赞誉有加。 ||| Exarchos, also the executive director of Olympic Channel Services, heaped praise on the show after watching rehearsals.
埃克萨科斯在国际奥委会发布会上透露：“我能告诉你们的是，这场开幕式和2008年北京夏季奥运会开幕式一样震撼，而我们知道2008年奥运会开幕式是有史以来最精彩的奥运会开幕式之一。” ||| "What I can probably tell you is that this ceremony is probably equally impressive as the one in 2008, which we know is one of the most iconic opening ceremonies in the history of the Olympic Games," Exarchos told an International Olympic Committee technical briefing for the Games.
而且这次开幕式与之前截然不同。 ||| And it's completely different.
同样震撼、同样动人但截然不同。 ||| It's equally impressive, equally moving, but completely different.
它反映出了我们的时代。 ||| It reflects our times.
作为转播团队的一份子，来自希腊的埃克萨科斯和著名导演张艺谋曾携手向世界呈现2008奥运会开幕式，他将这次经历描述为“职业生涯中的高光时刻”。 ||| As part of the broadcasting team, Exarchos worked with acclaimed director Zhang Yimou to present the 2008 showpiece to the world, which the Greek described as "a highlight of my professional life".
如今张艺谋再次被任命为2022冬奥会开幕式总导演，埃克萨科斯表示他很期盼又有机会和这位了解转播方和电视制片人需求的导演合作。 ||| With Zhang reappointed chief director for the 2022 Games' ceremonies, Exarchos said he was relishing having another chance to work with a director who understands the needs of broadcasters and TV producers.
他兴奋地说：“开幕式已基本准备就绪，这是一场任何人无论什么原因都不该错过的开幕式。” ||| "The ceremony is practically ready, and it's a ceremony that nobody should miss for any reason," he enthused.
埃克萨科斯已经开始在闭环管理系统内工作，建立闭环管理系统旨在消除新冠疫情的威胁，他特别强调自己在奥运会现场感觉很安全。 ||| Already working in the closed-loop management system, which has been established to eliminate the threat of COVID-19, Exarchos was keen to stress just how safe he feels at the Games.
他说：“我们在一个非常非常安全的国家。” ||| "We are in a very, very safe country," he said.
国际奥委会媒体运营部副主任露西亚·蒙大娜瑞拉也有同样的感受，她发现闭环管理“运行起来很顺利”。 ||| Those sentiments were echoed by Lucia Montanarella, associate director of Olympic Games media operations of the IOC, who found the closed loop "has been working very well".
埃克萨科斯对2022北京奥运场馆也赞不绝口，他将其描述为“非常壮观，不仅是设计，技术水平也很高”。 ||| Exarchos also lavished praise on the Beijing 2022 venues, which he described as "really spectacular, not just the design, but the technical execution".
他说：“北京冬奥会的基础设施极为复杂，我必须承认，这很可能是我见过的最棒的冬奥会设施。” ||| "The infrastructure for the Olympic Games is very, very complex, I must say that it's probably the best we have ever seen in terms of a winter edition of the Olympic Games," he said.
“这非常非常重要，因为这意味着所有人都能在最好的条件下完成我们的工作。” ||| "This is very, very important, because it will mean that all of us will be able to do our work in the best possible conditions."
