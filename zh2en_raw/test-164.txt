5月24日得克萨斯州发生校园枪击事件后，美国保守党政客立即作出反应，再次推动学校教职员工配枪保护学生，这一提案在教师、研究人员和控枪活动家中引起强烈反对。 ||| Immediately after Tuesday's school shooting in Texas, conservative politicians reacted with another push for arming school officials to protect students – a notion that has raised strong objections among teachers, researchers and gun control activists.
得州总检察长肯·帕克斯顿24日对福克斯新闻表示：“我们可以武装、培训教师和其他管理人员，让他们有所准备，迅速做出反应，因为我们没办法在每一所学校安排执法人员。” ||| "We can arm and prepare and train teachers and other administrators to respond quickly, because the reality is we don't have the resources to have law enforcement at every school," Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Fox News on Tuesday.
得州已经率先开展了“校警计划”培训，教师和行政人员在得克萨斯州执法委员会监管的学院接受80小时的培训后便可以配枪。 ||| Texas has already pioneered such training, the School Marshal Program, which allows teachers and administrators to carry handguns after an 80-hour training at academies overseen by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement.
该计划于2013年颁布，并在共和党州长格雷格·阿伯特的领导下扩大。该委员会表示，得克萨斯州目前有256名校警，而在2018年休斯顿附近的圣达菲发生一起高中枪击案之前，只有34名。 ||| The program was enacted in 2013 and expanded under Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican. There are now 256 school marshals in Texas, up from 34 before a high school shooting in Santa Fe near Houston in 2018, the Commission said.
在5月24日的枪击事件中，一名18岁的枪手在得克萨斯州小镇乌瓦尔德的一所小学杀害了19名儿童和两名教师。乌瓦尔德位于圣安东尼奥市以西130公里。 ||| In Tuesday's shooting, an 18-year-old gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in the small Texan town of Uvalde 80 miles (130 km) west of the city of San Antonio.
据得克萨斯州执法委员会称，成为校警的条件包括属于学校雇员、通过心理测试和持有持枪执照。 ||| Requirements to become a marshal include being a school employee, passing a psychological exam and having a license to carry, according to the Commission.
对控枪活动家来说，校警计划是美国朝着错误方向迈出的又一步，美国是世界上武装程度最高的社会，枪击死亡率很高。 ||| For gun control activists, the program is another step in the wrong direction in the United States, which is by far the most heavily armed society in the world and has a high gun death rate.
控枪组织“母亲要求行动”创始人香农·瓦茨称：“总检察长的言论再次表明，枪支游说团体的走狗‘头目’得克萨斯州将尽一切努力避免解决枪支暴力问题。” ||| "The Attorney General's comments are yet another indication that the gun lobby lackeys 'leading' Texas will do literally anything to avoid addressing gun violence," said Shannon Watts, founder of gun control group Moms Demand Action.
得州教师协会反对校警计划，该计划是针对2012年康涅狄格州桑迪·胡克小学发生的大规模枪击案指定的。 ||| The Texas State Teachers Association has opposed the school marshal program, which was created in response to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.
得州教师协会发言人克莱·罗宾逊称：“他们需要采取更多措施，防止枪支进入学校，而不是在学校增加枪支。” ||| "Instead of adding more guns to schools they need to take more steps to keep guns out of schools," said spokesperson Clay Robison.
马里兰大学犯罪学家丹尼斯·戈特弗雷德森表示，武装教师是“不明智的”，她指出，研究表明，提供更多枪支可能会导致更多的枪支暴力。 ||| Arming teachers is "ill-advised," said Denise Gottfredson, a criminologist at the University of Maryland, pointing to research that more availability of guns is likely to lead to more gun violence.
戈特弗雷德森说：“这些枪可能会走火，配枪的老师可能会故意将其用于非预期目的，这些枪更有可能最终会落入学生手中。” ||| "These guns might be fired accidentally, the teachers who carry them might deliberately use them for unintended purposes, and, even more likely, the guns might end up in the hands of students," said Gottfredson.
