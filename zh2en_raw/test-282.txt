在米妮近100年的人生中，这是她第一次穿上裤装。 ||| For the first time in her nearly century-long life, Minnie Mouse will add a pantsuit to her wardrobe.
这可不是一条旧款女士休闲裤，而是出自英国时装设计师斯特拉·麦卡特尼之手的标志性作品。 ||| And it won't be just any old pair of tailored slacks, but an iconic silhouette from British fashion designer Stella McCartney.
米妮的新裤装先一步在网上和大家见面，她的全套新装扮将在3月份亮相，以纪念国际妇女节和巴黎迪士尼乐园开园30周年。 ||| Though a sneak peek of Minnie's new sartorial statement hit the internet early, her full makeover will be unveiled in March to commemorate two different dates: International Women's Day and the 30th anniversary of Disneyland Paris.
麦卡特尼在一个媒体采访视频中表示：“米妮在我心中一直占有一个特殊的位置。” ||| "Minnie has always had a special place in my heart," McCartney said in a press video.
我们拥有同样的价值观，我喜欢米妮是因为她是快乐、自我表达、真实的化身，而且她也很有范儿。 ||| We share the same values, and what I love about Minnie is that she personifies happiness, self-expression, authenticity...plus she has such great style.
裤装是女性领导人衣柜中的主打款，包括德国前总理安格拉·默克尔、美国前国务卿希拉里·克林顿和美国副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯在内的政界人士穿的裤装辨识度都很高。 ||| Pantsuits are a staple in female leaders' wardrobes, with politicians including former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and US Vice President Kamala Harris each having their own recognizable take on the style.
2004年白宫在克林顿任期结束三年后发布的希拉里官方肖像画曾引起了轰动，画像上希拉里穿着一身午夜黑的西服套装，这对于第一夫人的肖像画来说还是首例。 ||| Clinton caused a stir in 2004 when her official White House portrait was unveiled three years after the Clinton administration ended, showing her in a midnight black suit a first for a first lady's portrait.
米妮的这套彰显个性的服饰是一件蓝色定制礼服，上面点缀着黑色波点和一对蝴蝶结。 ||| Minnie's own statement-making ensemble is a bespoke blue tuxedo with black polka dots and matching bow.
麦卡特尼希望这一新形象能让米妮成为“新一代进步和赋权的象征”。 ||| McCartney hopes the new look will make Minnie "a symbol of progress and empowerment for a new generation."
不过，网友们指出，这不是米妮第一次换新装。 ||| Internet users, however, have pointed out that this is not Minnie's first time foregoing her dress.
2019年，迪士尼邮轮推出了穿红白海军服+裤装的米妮船长形象，这套服饰既是为了给年轻女孩带来启迪，在海上穿着也很实用。 ||| In 2019, Disney Cruise Line debuted Captain Minnie in a red and white maritime uniform with pants both as an inspirational outfit for young girls and, presumably, a practical one to be out at sea.
今年国际妇女节，迪士尼还将和麦卡特尼合作推出一个限量版T恤系列，T恤上印有米妮和“神圣女性”字样，该系列将于3月7日在斯特拉·麦卡特尼2022冬季时装秀的T台上亮相，并于次日上市销售。 ||| For this International Women's Day, the collaboration with McCartney will also include a limited T-shirt collection featuring Minnie with the phrase "Divine Feminine" which will appear on the runway at the March 7 Stella McCartney Winter 2022 show and be available for purchase the following day.
