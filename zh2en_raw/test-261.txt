一场科学“事故”的新数据显示，人在濒死时自己的一生会在眼前闪过。 ||| New data from a scientific "accident" has suggested that life may actually flash before our eyes as we die.
一个科学家团队为一名87岁的癫痫患者测量脑电波。 ||| A team of scientists set out to measure the brainwaves of an 87-year-old patient who had developed epilepsy.
但是在测量过程中患者突发心脏病死亡，从而意外记录下了濒死大脑的脑电波。 ||| But during the neurological recording, he suffered a fatal heart attack offering an unexpected recording of a dying brain.
脑电图显示，在死亡前后的30秒内，患者的脑电波经历了和做梦或回忆相同的模式。 ||| It revealed that in the 30 seconds before and after, the man's brainwaves followed the same patterns as dreaming or recalling memories.
该研究团队在2月22日发表在《衰老神经科学前沿》上的研究报告中写道，这种大脑活动意味着人在濒死时刻可能会对自己的一生进行“终极回顾”。 ||| Brain activity of this sort could suggest that a final "recall of life" may occur in a person's last moments, the team wrote in their study, published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience on Tuesday.
该研究的合著者阿杰马勒·真马尔博士表示，加拿大温哥华的研究团队意外获得的濒死者脑电图是史上首份。 ||| Dr Ajmal Zemmar, a co-author of the study, said that what the team, then based in Vancouver, Canada, accidentally got, was the first-ever recording of a dying brain.
那么人在濒死时会看见与所爱的人共度的时光和其他快乐的回忆吗？真马尔博士表示，这就无从得知了。 ||| So will we get a glimpse back at time with loved ones and other happy memories? Dr Zemmar said it was impossible to tell.
他说：“从哲学的角度推测，如果往事在大脑中闪回，大概率回放的是好事而非坏事。” ||| "If I were to jump to the philosophical realm, I would speculate that if the brain did a flashback, it would probably like to remind you of good things, rather than the bad things," he said.
“但是让每个人记忆深刻的东西都各有不同。” ||| "But what's memorable would be different for every person."
路易斯维尔大学的神经外科医生真马尔博士指出，在患者心脏停止向大脑供血前的30秒内，脑电波的模式和我们执行对认知力要求高的任务（比如集中注意力、做梦或回忆）时的脑电波一样。 ||| Dr Zemmar, now a neurosurgeon at the University of Louisville, said in the 30 seconds before the patient's heart stopped supplying blood to the brain, his brainwaves followed the same patterns as when we carry out high-cognitive demanding tasks, like concentrating, dreaming or recalling memories.
在患者心脏停止跳动后，这种脑电波模式会持续30秒。 ||| It continued 30 seconds after the patient's heart stopped beating.
真马尔博士说：“我认为这种濒死体验有一种神秘的超自然的成分在里面。” ||| "I think there's something mystical and spiritual about this whole near-death experience," Dr Zemmar said.
“这样的研究发现正是科学家梦寐以求的。” ||| "And findings like this it's a moment that scientists lives for."
