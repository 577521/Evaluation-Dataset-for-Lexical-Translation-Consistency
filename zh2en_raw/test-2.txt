我国可再生能源发电总装机在过去十年间增长了约90倍，装机规模稳居全球首位。 ||| China's total installed capacity of renewable energy generation has increased by around 90 times over the past 10 years, cementing its role as a global leader in renewable energy capacity growth.
国家能源局的数据显示，十年间，我国可再生能源发电总装机达到11亿千瓦，水电、风电、光伏发电、生物质发电装机规模稳居世界第一。 ||| The country's total installed capacity for renewable energy generation rose to 1.1 billion kilowatts during the last 10 years, with generation capacity of hydropower, wind, solar and biomass ranking tops in the world, according to the National Energy Administration.
其中，风电光伏并网装机合计6.7亿千瓦，是2012年的近90倍。 ||| The combined installed capacity of wind and solar power has reached 670 million kW, almost 90 times that in 2012, it said.
“十四五”时期（2021-2025年），我国可再生能源发电量增量在全社会用电量增量中的占比将超过50%，风电和太阳能发电量将实现翻倍。 ||| During the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period, China's renewable energy generation capacity is expected to account for more than 50 percent of the total and the generation capacity for wind and solar power is to be doubled, it said.
国家能源局称，可再生能源已成为我国发电新增装机的主体。 ||| According to the NEA, renewable energy has become the principal source of the country's newly added installed generation capacity.
今年1-5月份，全国可再生能源发电新增装机4349万千瓦，占全国发电新增装机的82.1%。 ||| In the first five months, the country's newly-added installed capacity for renewable energy generation rose to 43.49 million kW, 82.1 percent of the country's newly added power generation installed capacity, the administration said.
可就在十年前，当时我国新能源发电占比只有2.7%，能源结构偏煤、能源效率偏低。 ||| The figure was only 2.7 percent 10 years ago when the country still relied heavily on coal with relatively lower energy efficiency, it said.
十年间，我国已形成较为完备的可再生能源技术产业体系。 ||| China has also developed a complete industrial system of renewable energy technology during the past 10 years.
现在我国已具备全球最大的百万千瓦水轮机组自主设计制造能力，光伏发电技术快速迭代， 10兆瓦海上风机开始批量生产 ||| It is now capable of independently designing and manufacturing the world's largest megawatt-scale hydraulic turbine set while solar power generation technology has also witnessed rapid development and 10 MW offshore wind turbines have also entered volume production.
仅2021年，我国可再生能源开发利用规模相当于7.53亿吨标准煤，减少二氧化碳、二氧化硫、氮氧化物排放量分别约达20.7亿吨、40万吨与45万吨。 ||| As a result, the scale of development and utilization of renewable energy in the country was equivalent to 753 million metric tons of standard coal last year, reducing 2.07 billion tons of carbon dioxide, 400,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 450,000 tons of nitrogen oxide.
