高峰称：“中方愿同欧方一道，积极推动贸易投资自由化便利化，维护产业链供应链稳定畅通，共同把中欧经贸合作的蛋糕越做越大、越做越好，造福双方企业和民众。” ||| "China is willing to join hands with the EU to proactively promote the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment, safeguard the stability and smooth operations of industrial and supply chains, and jointly elevate China-EU economic and trade cooperation to benefit enterprises and people of both sides," he said.

高峰表示，自3月18日起，区域全面经济伙伴关系协定（RCEP）将对马来西亚正式生效。中马之间相互履行RCEP市场开放承诺和各领域规则，将进一步提升两国贸易投资合作水平，为两国企业和消费者带来更多红利，也将有利于区域产业链供应链优势互补、深度融合，为区域经济增长作出新贡献。 ||| The spokesman also said the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement in Malaysia from Friday will further boost trade and investment cooperation between China and Malaysia, and benefit enterprises and consumers of both countries as the two countries deliver on their market openness commitments and apply RCEP rules in various areas. That will also enhance the optimization and deep integration of regional industrial and supply chains to make more contributions to regional economic growth, he said.
