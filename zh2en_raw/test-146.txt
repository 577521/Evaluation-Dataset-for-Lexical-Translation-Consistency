中国政府周三表示，为进一步推动能源清洁低碳转型，实现高质量发展，新增可再生能源消费不纳入能源消费总量控制。 ||| Newly added renewable capacity will be exempt from energy consumption caps to further promote clean and low-carbon energy transformation and ensure high-quality development in the country, the government said on Wednesday.
国家发展改革委、国家统计局、国家能源局周三发布联合声明，明确新增可再生能源，包括风电、太阳能发电、水电、生物质发电、地热能消费不纳入能源消费总量控制。 ||| Consumption of newly added renewable energy, including wind, solar, hydro, biomass and geothermal power, will not be included in the total energy consumption control in China, said a statement jointly released by the National Development and Reform Commission, the National Bureau of Statistics and the National Energy Administration on Wednesday.
该声明称，在开展全国和地方能源消费总量考核时，以各地区2020年可再生能源电力消费量为基数，每年较上一年新增的可再生能源电力消费量在考核时予以扣除。 ||| Based on electricity consumption from renewable energy sources in 2020, the annual increase in power consumption from renewable sources compared with the previous year will be deducted from the assessment of total national and local energy consumption, according to the statement.
通知明确以绿证作为可再生能源电力消费量认定的基本凭证，政府还将积极推动绿证交易体系建设。 ||| The green certificate will be the basic certificate of renewable energy power consumption identification and the government will also actively promote the construction of the green certificate trading market, it said.
自2006年实施以来，能耗总量和强度“双控”制度一直是中国脱碳的关键驱动力。 ||| China's "dual control" policy — controlling energy consumption and energy intensity — has been a key driver of China's decarbonization since its implementation in 2006.
根据十四五计划，到2025年，中国将实现单位GDP能源消耗比2021年降低13.5%的目标。 ||| The nation is committed to reducing the energy intensity of its economy by 13.5 percent between 2021 and 2025.
彭博新能源财经电力市场分析师魏汉阳表示，“双控”制度助力中国推动能源转型和低碳发展。 ||| Wei Hanyang, a power market analyst at BloombergNEF, said the energy intensity targets and caps on total energy consumption have helped drive its energy transition and low-carbon development.
“可再生能源消费不纳入能源消费总量控制，有助于消除企业整体增长的限制，并刺激当地发展，”魏伟说。 ||| "The exemption of using renewables in total energy consumption helps remove a cap on the overall growth of enterprises and stimulates local development," Wei said.
“此举还将刺激对可再生能源领域的投资。” ||| "It will also pass on the stimulus for renewable energy investment."
