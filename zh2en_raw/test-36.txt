2001年，习近平担任福建省省长期间，曾接待过时任塔斯马尼亚州州长的吉姆·培根访问。 ||| Until then, Tasmania had sister-state ties with Fujian province, where Xi was once governor.
两人一道签署了福建省和塔斯马尼亚州建立友好省州关系20周年联合声明，习近平还授予培根福建省荣誉公民称号。培根于1998年至2004年间担任塔斯马尼亚州长，他从刚上大学起就多次来访福建。 ||| In 2001, Xi awarded honorary Fujian citizenship posthumously to Jim Bacon, who had served as Tasmania's premier from 1998 to 2004 and who had been a regular visitor to Fujian since his early university days.
到2014年，塔斯马尼亚已与中国签订了从风电农场到农业等多个领域的系列协议。 ||| Before 2014, Tasmania had made several agreements with China on initiatives ranging from wind farms to agriculture.
习近平主席和夫人彭丽媛到达塔斯马尼亚首府霍巴特的那天，当地一家报纸在头版刊登了一篇热情洋溢的社论，标题是“欢迎您，主席先生”，结尾写道：“我们期待友谊地久天长。希望您能享受在这里的时光。” ||| On the day that Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, arrived in Hobart, the Tasmanian capital, a local newspaper carried an effusive front-page editorial, which ran under the headline "Welcome, Mr President" and ended: "We look forward to continuing a long and prosperous friendship.

习近平在访问塔斯马尼亚州期间，看望了来自朗塞斯顿市斯科奇—欧克伯恩学校的学生们, 这些孩子们为了此次会面专程来到霍巴特市。 ||| However, the most memorable part of the visit to Tasmania was a meeting with the students of Scotch Oakburn College in the city of Launceston, who had traveled to Hobart for the occasion.

习主席提到了我的名字，把我称作中澳人民友谊的桥梁，这对我来说是莫大的荣誉。" ||| He did me the honor of mentioning me by name, calling me a bridge of friendship between the Chinese and Australian peoples.

马克林表示：“我认为中国确实一直坚持走共同发展道路，但我不认为其他大国也在往同一个方向努力。” ||| Mackerras, the Sinologist, said, "I think China is indeed adhering to the path of common development, but I don't think other major countries are making things easier."
马克林说，自那以后，中澳关系变了很多。其中一个原因可能是，国际环境在2014年之后发生了很大改变。 ||| A lot has happened in the China-Australia relationship since then. For one thing, the international environment has changed greatly since Xi's visit in 2014, Mackerras said.
“美国和其它一些西方国家转而将中国视为敌人，他们的目的无非是维持自己在世界上的霸权。” ||| "The United States and many other Western countries have moved to regard China as a kind of enemy, their purose being to maintain their own supremacy in the world.
“澳大利亚一些政客处心积虑地将中国构陷为敌人和威胁，其实中国既不是敌人也不是威胁。 ||| "Australia has been quite deliberate about this, framing China as an enemy and a threat.
我认为（澳）政界几乎无人挑战这一说法很可耻。” ||| It is neither of those things, and I regard it as a disgrace that virtually nobody in the political sphere challenges this narrative."
马克林说，尽管习近平主席始终倡导构建人类命运共同体，坚持各国平等相待、团结合作，但是现在澳大利亚一些政府官员“始终都在抗拒，更愿意竞争而不是合作”。 ||| Mackerras said that while Xi has consistently talked about the shared future of humanity, trying to frame countries as equals and trying to get people to cooperate, some current officials "have resisted that at all times, preferring to compete, not to cooperate".
他补充道，让他尤其感到悲伤的是一些澳大利亚政界人士不再将中国视为朋友的事实。 ||| He added that what especially saddens him is the fact that some Australian politicians no longer regard China as a friend.
在谈及澳新工党政府可能带来的改变时，马克林说：“我不确定，但至少有改善的机会。” ||| Referring to the possibility of things changing under the new Labor government, Mackerras said, "I'm not sure, but there's at least a chance of improvement."
他说，他认为中国仍然希望能和澳大利亚成为重要的合作伙伴，中国驻澳大利亚大使肖千自今年1月上任以来“一直做得非常好”。 ||| He said he believes that China still hopes to have Australia as an important partner, and that Xiao Qian, who has been China's ambassador to Australia since January, "is doing a very good job".
马克林说：“我认为2014年是一个黄金之年，而现在情况已经大不如前。工党的行事风格会好一些，我希望工党政府对中国的政策能有所改善。” ||| "I look back on 2014 as a golden year, and things are much worse now," Mackerras said. "Labor will be better in its style and, I hope, in the content of its policy toward China.
“我并不指望一切能重新开始，但是仍有很多机会……我对此持乐观态度。” ||| "So I'm not holding my breath for a reset, but there's a good chance... and I'm optimistic."
