一项同类型中最大规模研究发现，与曾感染其他呼吸道病毒的患者相比，数百万新冠肺炎患者在痊愈两年后患脑雾、痴呆和精神错乱等神经系统疾病和精神疾病的风险更高。 ||| Millions of people who have had Covid-19 still face a higher risk of neurological and psychiatric conditions, including brain fog, dementia and psychosis, two years after their illness, compared with those who have had other respiratory infections, according to the single largest study of its kind.
研究显示，这些人患焦虑和抑郁的风险也更高，但是这些症状会在感染新冠病毒两月内消退。 ||| They also face an increased risk of anxiety and depression, the research suggests, but this subsides within two months of having Covid-19.
新冠肺炎患者在病愈两年后患焦虑和抑郁的风险不比感染其他呼吸道病毒的患者更高。 ||| Over two years the risk is no more likely than after other respiratory infections.
该研究结果发表在《柳叶刀·精神病学》期刊上。 ||| The findings are published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal.
疫情暴发以来全球已有近6亿人确诊新冠肺炎，而且越来越多的证据表明存活下来的新冠患者患神经系统疾病和精神疾病的风险更高。 ||| Almost 600m Covid-19 cases have been recorded worldwide since the start of the pandemic, and there has been growing evidence that people who survive the disease face increased risks of neurological and psychiatric conditions.
先前的研究发现，感染新冠病毒后的前6个月患神经系统和心理健康疾病的风险更高。 ||| Previous studies have found that people face higher risks of several neurological and mental health conditions in the first six months after infection.
然而，迄今为止还没有对这些长期后遗症的风险进行大规模的数据分析。 ||| Until now, however, there has been no large-scale data examining the risks over a longer time period.
牛津大学和英国国家健康与护理研究所牛津健康生物医学研究中心开展的这项新研究用了两年时间对128万新冠病例进行了分析。 ||| The new study, by the University of Oxford and the National Institute for Health and Care Research Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, analysed 1.28m Covid-19 cases over two years.
这一分析工作的领头人、来自牛津大学的麦克斯·塔奎特博士称：“我们的研究发现进一步揭示了新冠病毒给感染者的心理和大脑健康带来的长期后遗症。” ||| Dr Max Taquet, who led the analyses at the University of Oxford, said: “The findings shed new light on the longer-term mental and brain health consequences for people following Covid-19 infection.”
该研究发现，成年人在感染新冠病毒后患抑郁或焦虑的风险会增加，但是在大约两个月后又会回落到与感染其他呼吸道病毒的患者相当的水平。 ||| The study found that in adults the risk of depression or anxiety increased after Covid-19 but returned to the same as with other respiratory infections within about two months.
然而，新冠患者在感染病毒两年后，患上神经系统疾病和精神健康疾病的风险却依然高于感染其他呼吸道病毒的患者。 ||| However, the risk of some other neurological and mental health conditions remained higher after Covid-19 than for other respiratory infections at the end of the two-year follow-up.
感染新冠病毒的64岁以下成人患脑雾的风险相比感染其他呼吸道病毒的患者更高，前者每1万例会出现640例脑雾患者，后者每1万例会出现550例脑雾患者。 ||| Adults aged 64 and under who had Covid-19 had a higher risk of brain fog, 640 cases per 10,000 people, compared with those who had other respiratory infections, 550 cases per 10,000 people.
65岁以上的新冠患者出现脑雾（每1万例有1540例）、痴呆（每1万例有450例）和神经错乱（每1万例有85例）的几率都高于感染过其他呼吸道病毒的患者，后者患脑雾、痴呆和神经错乱的几率分别为每1万例有1230例、每1万例有330例、每1万例有60例。 ||| In those aged 65 and over who had Covid-19, there was a higher occurrence of brain fog (1,540 cases per 10,000 people), dementia (450 cases per 10,000 people) and psychotic disorders (85 cases per 10,000 people) compared with those who previously had a different respiratory infection (1,230 cases per 10,000 for brain fog, 330 cases per 10,000 for dementia and 60 cases per 10,000 for psychotic disorder).
与成人患者一样，感染过新冠病毒并康复的儿童更容易患上癫痫、神经错乱等疾病。 ||| Like adults, children recovering from Covid-19 were more likely to be diagnosed with some conditions, including seizures and psychotic disorders.
在德尔塔毒株流行期间感染病毒的患者出现神经系统疾病和神经错乱的几率比早前阿尔法毒株流行期间更高。 ||| More neurological and psychiatric disorders were seen during the Delta variant wave than with the prior Alpha variant.
在奥密克戎毒株流行期间感染病毒的患者出现神经系统疾病和神经错乱的风险则与德尔塔毒株流行期间相近。 ||| The Omicron wave was linked with similar neurological and psychiatric risks as Delta.
该研究的带头人、来自牛津大学的保罗·哈里森教授称：“好消息是，尽管很多人在感染新冠病毒后被确诊患上抑郁和焦虑症，但是这些症状很快会消失，而且没有观察到儿童患抑郁和焦虑的风险因感染新冠病毒而增加。” ||| Prof Paul Harrison, who led the study at the University of Oxford, said: “It is good news that the excess of depression and anxiety diagnoses after Covid-19 is short-lived, and that it is not observed in children.”
然而，令人忧心的是，在感染新冠病毒长达两年后，患者确诊痴呆和癫痫等疾病的风险依然更高。 ||| However, it is worrying that some other disorders, such as dementia and seizures, continue to be more likely diagnosed after Covid-19, even two years later.
