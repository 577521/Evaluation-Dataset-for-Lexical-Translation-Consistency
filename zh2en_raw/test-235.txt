3月15日，工程师们在法国最具代表性的地标建筑埃菲尔铁塔顶部安装了一个新的通信天线，使其高度增加了6米。 ||| The Eiffel Tower grew by six meters (nearly 20 feet) on Tuesday after engineers hoisted a new communications antenna at the very top of France’s most iconic landmark.
埃菲尔铁塔由古斯塔夫·埃菲尔在19世纪末设计建造。在灰蒙蒙的天空下，一段数字音频天线被直升机空运到塔顶，埃菲尔铁塔增高至330米。 ||| The tower, built by Gustave Eiffel in the late 19th century, now measures 330 metres after the DAB+ (digital audio) antenna was airlifted onto its peak by helicopter under a leaden sky.
现场电视画面显示，直升机将天线降到塔顶的基座上，不到10分钟，工作人员将其固定。 ||| Live television images showed the helicopter lowering the antenna onto its base atop the tower, where workmen made it secure in an operation that lasted less than 10 minutes.
1889年3月31日，埃菲尔铁塔落成时高312米。 ||| The Eiffel Tower was 312 meters (1,024 feet) high when it was inaugurated on March 31, 1889.
在建造过程中，埃菲尔铁塔超过了华盛顿纪念碑，成为世界上最高的人造建筑，这一头衔保持了40年，直到1929年纽约市的克莱斯勒大厦超越它。 ||| During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for four decades until the Chrysler Building in New York City was topped off in 1929.
据旅游网站猫途鹰称，埃菲尔铁塔是全球最具人气的景点之一。 ||| The wrought-iron lattice tower is among the most visited tourist sites in the world, according to TripAdvisor.
然而，100多年来，埃菲尔铁塔也被用于广播传输，随着老化天线的更换，它的巅峰高度发生了多次变化。 ||| It has, however, also been used for broadcast transmissions for more than 100 years, with the height of its pinnacle changing numerous times as ageing antennas were replaced.
