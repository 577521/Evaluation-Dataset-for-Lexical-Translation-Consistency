俄罗斯列宁格勒地区的一家公司最近铺设了一小段草莓味柏油马路，这一试验工程是为了帮助解决柏油马路气味难闻的问题。 ||| A company in Russia’s Leningrad region recently laid a small section of strawberry-scented asphalt as an experiment to help solve the problem of unpleasant odors.
不知道你是否闻过正在铺设过程中的热乎乎的柏油马路的气味，但这绝不是世界上最好闻的气味。幸运的是，我们可能不用再长时间忍受这种气味了，因为有些公司已经开始想办法解决这个问题了。 ||| I don’t know if you’ve ever smelled hot asphalt when road sections are being laid or fixed, but it’s not the most appealing odor in the world. Luckily, we may not have to put up with it for much longer, as companies are beginning to come up with solutions to this issue.
波兰的一家公司前不久刚推出一种花香柏油来改善修路工人的日常劳动条件，短短几个月后，俄罗斯的一家公司就用草莓味柏油成功铺就了一段700米长的道路。 ||| Just a few months after a Polish company came up with floral-scented asphalt to improve working conditions for the people working with it on a daily basis, a Russian company has successfully laid a 700-meter-long stretch of road using strawberry-scented asphalt.
俄罗斯国际文传电讯社宣称：“承包商想出了这个解决办法，这是他们自己主动提出的。 ||| "The contractor came up with this solution, this was their own initiative,” Russia’s Interfax news agency announced.
许多人不喜欢修路过程中散发出的热乎乎的柏油味道，于是他们决定尝试一下。” ||| “Many people do not like the smell of overheated bitumen, which spreads during the repair process, so they decided to try it.”
承包商为这次试验生产了约300吨草莓味柏油混合材料, 6月30日在列宁格勒弗谢沃洛日斯克区铺就的这条700米长的草莓味柏油路是俄罗斯安全优质道路国家工程的一部分。 ||| Laid on June 30th, in Leningrad’s Vsevolozhsk district, the 700-meter-long strawberry-scented asphalt road is part of Russia’s Safe High-Quality Roads national project, about 300 tons of strawberry-scented asphalt mix were produced for this experiment.
目前还不清楚这次试验有多成功，也不知道草莓味能持续多久，但是承包商明确提到草莓味绝对不会影响柏油质量。 ||| It’s unclear how successful the experiment actually was, or how long the scent of strawberries lasted, but the contractor did mention that the strawberry scent does not affect the quality of the asphalt at all.
