美国最高法院推翻“罗诉韦德案”，不再承认美国宪法规定的堕胎权, 世界卫生组织负责人谴责这一裁决“令人失望”，最终将以生命为代价。 ||| The head of the World Health Organization on Wednesday criticized the US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, saying the decision to no longer recognize a constitutional right to abortion was “a setback” that would ultimately cost lives.
世卫组织总干事谭德塞对媒体表示，数十年的科学数据表明，允许安全合法堕胎可以挽救生命。 ||| WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing that decades of scientific data prove that access to safe and legal abortion saves lives.
谭德塞称：“这些证据是无可辩驳的，限制（堕胎）迫使女性进行不安全的堕胎，可能导致并发症，甚至死亡。” ||| “The evidence is irrefutable,” Tedros said. “Restricting (abortion) drives women and girls toward unsafe abortions resulting in complications, even death.”
他说，安全堕胎应属于医疗保障，并警告限制堕胎权对最贫穷和最边缘化群体中的女性的影响更大。 ||| He said safe abortion should be understood as health care and warned that limiting its access would disproportionately hit women from the poorest and most marginalized communities.
谭德塞称：“我们对美国的做法非常意外。”他担心美国最高法院的裁决是“历史倒退”。 ||| “We hadn’t really expected this from the US,” Tedros said, adding that he was concerned the Supreme Court’s decision was a move “backwards.”
世卫组织首席科学家苏米娅·斯瓦米纳坦博士称，联合国卫生署对堕胎的立场是基于数十年来在多个国家收集的数据。 ||| The WHO’s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said the UN health agency’s position on abortion was based on decades of data from numerous countries.
斯瓦米纳坦说：“根据我在印度工作的经验，我知道允许安全堕胎是一项挽救生命的措施”。 ||| “I know from own experience, working in India, that having access to safe abortion is a life-saving measure,” Swaminathan said.
禁止女性堕胎就像“禁止给某些人服用救命药”。 ||| She said denying a woman access to abortion was “like denying someone a life-saving drug.”
她表示，禁止堕胎无助于减少堕胎手术的数量，而那些进行不安全堕胎的人有可能出现致命的血液感染。 ||| She said bans on abortion would do little to reduce the number of procedures while people who undergo unsafe abortions are at risk of developing fatal blood infections.
斯瓦米纳坦称，近年来，各国的趋势是逐渐允许堕胎，包括拉丁美洲等强烈反对堕胎的地区。 ||| In recent years, the trend among countries has been to increase access to abortion, including regions where there was staunch opposition, like Latin America, she said.
斯瓦米纳塔称：“不幸的是，一些国家正在倒退。” ||| “It’s unfortunate to see some countries going backward,” Swaminathan said, citing the US decision.
