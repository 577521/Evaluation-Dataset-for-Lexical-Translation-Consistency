英国影子内阁女性和平等部大臣安纳利斯·多兹表示，调查数据表明女性掌握着经济复苏的关键，但是女性却被投资不足和“育儿荒漠”风险拉住了后腿。她指责英国政府在新冠疫情期间忽视女性的需求，并在经济复苏计划中把女性排除在外。 ||| Accusing the government of ignoring women’s needs during the coronavirus pandemic and side-lining them in plans for recovery, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, Anneliese Dodds, said the data showed women held the key to a stronger economy, but they were being held back by a lack of investment and the risk of “childcare deserts”.
她警告称，英国正面临着“育儿危机”和托幼机构招聘难的问题。早期教育联盟报告称，英国部分地区的托幼名额在过去六年内减少了25%。 ||| She warned that the UK was facing a “childcare emergency” with early years settings struggling to recruit staff and the Early Years Alliance reporting that some areas of England have seen a 25% decline in the number of places in the past six years.
多兹说：“托幼行业正在面临一场短期危机，英国不同地区都出现了‘育儿荒漠’，托幼机构纷纷破产，无法继续运营，这给职场女性带来了可怕的后果。 ||| "The childcare sector is facing a short-term emergency, seeing childcare deserts in different parts of the country, with providers going bust and not being able to continue operating – that has an awful impact on working women,” said Dodds.
托幼机构是英国经济基础设施的一部分，我们必须找到更加可持续的方式来发展托幼机构。” ||| “Childcare providers are part of our economic infrastructure, we have to find a more sustainable way forward.”
