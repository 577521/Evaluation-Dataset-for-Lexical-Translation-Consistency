这两只熊猫玲玲和兴兴在史密森尼国家动物园生活了20多年。 ||| The two pandas, Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing, lived at the national zoo for more than 20 years.
它们的到来不仅给数千万美国人带来温暖和欢乐，还开启了中美大熊猫项目。 ||| Their arrival not only brought warmth and joy to tens of millions of Americans but also launched the US-China giant panda program.
现在，熊猫夫妇美香和添添，以及它们的幼崽、2020年8月出生的小奇迹居住在动物园里。 ||| Now the panda couple, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji ("little miracle"), born in August 2020, live at the national zoo.

史密斯回忆，雄性大熊猫贝贝和小奇迹比它们的兄弟泰山“更外向”。 ||| Smith recalled that the males, Bei Bei and Xiao Qi Ji are "more outgoing" than their brother Tai Shan.
她说：“我与这些大熊猫相遇，我非常了解它们，我记得所有熊猫幼崽在这里降生的时刻。我们知道它们出生后，将前往中国，成为群体繁殖项目的一部分。” ||| "I met these pandas; I know them so well, I remember the moments all of the cubs were born here. And one thing is that we know when they are born that they're going to go to China to be part of the group breeding program," she said.
“所以就像小宝宝一样。 ||| "So it's almost like any baby.
当他们长大后，如果你想让他们走出去并取得成功，就不能让他们留在你身边，因此我们的熊猫幼崽将前往中国，它们将繁育自己的幼崽，并帮助保护这个物种。” ||| When any baby grows up, you don't want them to stay with you if you want them to go out and to succeed, and so our cubs will go to China, and they will have their cubs and help contribute to the conservation of the species."
史密斯说，与中国动物园工作人员的合作给她留下了深刻印象。 ||| Smith said she has been impressed by the cooperation with the zoo staff's counterparts in China.
“我真的很喜欢与大熊猫一起工作。 ||| "I have really loved working with the giant pandas.
可以与它们工作，并了解这个物种实在太棒了。 ||| They're incredible animals to work with and get to know them as a species.
但我最喜欢的不仅仅是与大熊猫一起工作，还有与中国同事共事。” ||| But also, one of my favorite parts is it's not just about working with these animals. It has been about working with colleagues in China,"
“与中国的科学家和其他相关人员合作，分享大熊猫栖息地、大熊猫文化等相关知识，对我来说真是一次不可思议的经历。” ||| "So working with our scientists and other contributors in China to share knowledge about pandas, their habitat and their culture has really been an incredible experience for me."
新冠疫情为人员交流往来带来了障碍。 ||| The COVID-19 pandemic has created obstacles for in-person communications.
史密斯说：“通常我们一年要去中国好几次，中国同事们试着来美国探望我们。疫情期间，这很难，我们还不能见面，但还好我们仍然有电子邮件、视频电话和其他沟通方式。” ||| "Normally we go to China several times a year, and our colleagues are trying to come here to visit us. With the pandemic, it's been hard because we haven't been able to see each other in person, but the good thing is that we still have emails, video calls and other ways to communicate," Smith said.
“我认为这个项目一直都很棒。因为多年来我们一直保持着良好的关系，我们配合得很好。” ||| "And from my perspective, it has been as good as it always is. Because we've had such a good relationship over so many years, we respond to each other so well."
史密斯希望该项目“至少还能持续50年”。 ||| She said she hoped the program "could last for at least another 50 years".
在采访史密斯的过程中，美香和小奇迹在熊猫馆的一块户外场地里嬉戏，而添添则在另一边悠闲地嚼着竹子，游客蜂拥而至围观它们。 ||| During the interview with Smith, Mei Xiang and Xiao Qi Ji frolicked in an outdoor field of the panda house, while Tian Tian leisurely chewed on bamboo in another field as visitors streamed in to observe the pandas.
