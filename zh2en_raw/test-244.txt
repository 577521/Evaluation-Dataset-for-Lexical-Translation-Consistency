美国员工正纷纷离职，寻找更好的工作机会。 ||| US workers are walking off the job — and finding a better one.
“大离职潮”是疫情期间的一大现象，今年1月份约430万美国人跳槽，去年11月离职人数达到了450万的高峰。 ||| Some 4.3 million people quit their job for another in January in a pandemic-era phenomenon that’s become known as “The Great Resignation.” Quits peaked at 4.5 million in November.
在新冠疫情暴发前，美国每月平均离职人数不到300万。 ||| Before COVID-19, that figure averaged at fewer than 3 million quits per month.
然而疫情是美国人离职的头号原因吗？其实人们的离职原因还和以前一样。 ||| But the No. 1 reason they’re quitting? It’s the same old story.
总部在华盛顿特区的智库皮尤研究中心开展了一项涵盖9000多人的调查，结果发现美国人去年离职的头号原因是薪酬低以及缺乏晋升机会（各占63%），其次是在职场中感觉不受尊重（57%）。 ||| Workers say low pay and a lack of opportunities for advancement (63% respectively) are the biggest reason why they quit their jobs last year, followed by feeling disrespected at work (57%), according to a survey of more than 9,000 people by the Pew Research Center, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.
皮尤研究中心指出：“约半数（48%）家中有18岁以下孩子的受访者表示，无人照料孩子是自己离职的原因之一。 ||| "Roughly half say child-care issues were a reason they quit a job (48% among those with a child younger than 18 in the household),” Pew said.
还有相近比例的受访者表示离职是因为缺乏弹性工作时间（45%）或没有医保、带薪休假等福利（43%）。” ||| “A similar share point to a lack of flexibility to choose when they put in their hours (45%) or not having good benefits such as health insurance and paid time off (43%).”
随着疫情相关的经济刺激礼包发放完毕，通货膨胀又创下40年新高，人们被迫增加工作时间和寻求更高的薪酬。 ||| Pressures have intensified for people to work more hours and/or for better wages with inflation now at a 40-year high as COVID-related stimulus programs wind down.
与此同时，信用卡债务和利率节节攀升，长达两年不确定又不稳定的工作环境也让人们花掉了许多积蓄。 ||| Meanwhile, credit-card debt and interest rates are on the rise, and two years of an uncertain and unsteady work environment has taken a toll on people’s savings.
不过，皮尤研究中心也带来了好消息：超半数（56%）跳槽的员工表示，他们现在薪水增加了，有更多升职机会，能更好地平衡工作和家庭责任，工作时间也更有弹性了。 ||| The good news: More than half of workers who switched jobs say that they’re now earning more money (56%), have more opportunities for advancement, have an easier time balancing work and family responsibilities, and have more flexibility to choose when they put in their work hours, Pew said.
但是，在皮尤问及离职原因是否与新冠疫情有关时，超30%的受访者给出了肯定的答案。 ||| However, when asked whether their reasons for quitting a job were related to COVID-19, over 30% of those in the Pew survey said yes.
皮尤调查报告补充道：“那些没有大学四年本科学历的人（34%）比那些拥有本科以上学历的人（21%）更倾向于认为疫情和自己离职的决定有关。” ||| “Those without a four-year college degree (34%) are more likely than those with a bachelor’s degree or more education (21%) to say the pandemic played a role in their decision,” it added.
为了进一步了解员工的心声，盖洛普公司询问了逾1.3万名美国员工这个问题：在决定是否要接受一份新工作时，哪个因素对他们影响最大？ ||| In an effort to cast more light on worker sentiment, Gallup asked more than 13,000 US employees what was most important to them when deciding whether to accept a new job.
据盖洛普职场管理实务部调研和策略主管本·韦格特透露，受访者列出了6个因素。 ||| Respondents listed six factors, said Ben Wigert, the director of research and strategy for Gallup’s workplace management practice.
员工跳槽的第一大原因是收入或福利有显著增加，其次是改善工作与生活间的平衡、提升个人幸福感，然后是能够做自己最擅长的事、工作稳定有保障、与自己理念相合的新冠疫苗接种政策，还有机构的多元化和对各种人员的包容性。 ||| A significant rise in income or benefits was the No. 1 reason, followed by greater work-life balance and better personal well-being, the ability to do what they do best, greater stability and job security, COVID-19 vaccination policies that align with their beliefs, and the organization’s diversity and inclusivity of all types of people.
