接种新冠疫苗不会影响一对夫妇的受孕几率，但是感染新冠病毒可能会损害男性的生育能力。 ||| Getting vaccinated against Covid-19 won’t affect a couple’s chances of getting pregnant, but contracting the coronavirus could impair male fertility.
这个结论来自于美国国家卫生研究院资助的一项研究，该研究驳斥了关于疫苗的普遍误解，并向拒绝接种疫苗的男性发出提醒。 ||| Those are the main conclusions of a study funded by the National Institutes of Health, refuting a common myth about the vaccine and sending a warning to men who avoid it.
波士顿大学的研究人员对2000多对夫妇进行了研究，发现与未接种疫苗的夫妇相比，接种疫苗的夫妇受孕的几率没有差异。 ||| Researchers at Boston University studied more than 2,000 couples and found no differences in their chances of conception if either partner was vaccinated compared to unvaccinated couples.
但是，如果男性伴侣在女性月经周期前60天内或更短时间内感染了新冠病毒，夫妇的受孕几率会略有下降，这表明男性伴侣生育能力有所下降。 ||| But the couples’ chances of conceiving decreased slightly if the male partner had contracted the virus 60 days or less before a menstrual cycle, an indication of diminished male fertility.
研究人员推测，一个可能原因是感染新冠病毒可能会导致发烧，而众所周知，发烧会减少精子数量。 ||| One possible reason for that, researchers theorised, is the likelihood coronavirus infection would cause a fever, which has been known to reduce sperm count.
研究显示，在女性月经周期60天之前检测出新冠病毒阳性的男性，他们的伴侣怀孕几率与未感染新冠的男性其伴侣怀孕几率相同。 ||| Among the males in the study who tested positive more than 60 days before the cycle, conception rates were the same as males who had not been infected.
但在60天内被感染的男性的伴侣在该周期怀孕的可能性要低18%。 ||| But couples in which the male was infected within that 60-day window were 18 percent less likely to conceive in that cycle.
美国国家卫生研究院尤尼斯·肯尼迪·施莱弗国家儿童健康与人类发展研究所主任戴安娜·比安奇说：“研究结果再次证明，接种疫苗似乎不会损害想要怀孕的夫妇的生育能力。” ||| “The findings provide reassurance that vaccination for couples seeking pregnancy does not appear to impair fertility,” said Diana Bianchi, director of NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
关于新冠疫苗影响妊娠和生育能力的谣言非常普遍，一些医生主动向处于生育年龄的患者澄清传言。 ||| Misinformation about the impact of Covid-19 vaccines on pregnancy and fertility has been so prevalent that some doctors have proactively dispelled the myth with their patients of reproductive age.
2021年9月，美国疾病控制和预防中心紧急劝告孕妇或备孕人群接种新冠疫苗，因为在此前一个月，孕妇群体中新冠肺炎死亡病例创下最高纪录。 ||| In September 2021, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention urgently exhorted those who were pregnant or planning to conceive to get vaccinated, after the pandemic’ s highest number of Covid-19 deaths among pregnant people was recorded the month before.
