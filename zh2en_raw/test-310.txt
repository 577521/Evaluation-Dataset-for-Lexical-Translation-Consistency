自从远程工作让员工摆脱了地域限制，美国的离职人数创下了历史新高，这迫使许多员工开始重新评估他们和雇主之间的关系。 ||| Americans are walking away from their jobs in record numbers as remote work has uncoupled jobs from geography, and droves of employees are re-evaluating the relationships they have with their employers.
为了让员工快乐地留下来工作，越来越多的公司开始进行“劝留面谈”，与业绩最突出的员工进行一对一会面，让这些业务骨干有机会谈一谈现在工作中哪些方面是有成效的，哪些是行不通的。 ||| To keep workers happy and on the job, more companies are turning to “stay interviews,” one-on-one meetings with top performers to give those key people the chance to talk about what works, and what doesn’t work, about their current jobs.
美国人力资源管理学会的人力资源知识顾问罗宾·霍珀称：“尽可能让员工留下来……这已经成为非常热门的一个话题。” ||| "This has become an extremely popular topic ... to try and help retain employees as much as possible,” said Robyn Hopper, a human resources knowledge adviser for the Society for Human Resource Management.
开展劝留面谈的主管人员会按照培训内容询问员工一些开放式问题，比如这份工作让他们最喜欢的是什么，他们不喜欢什么，以及在什么情境下他们会离职。 ||| Managers who conduct stay interviews are coached to ask workers open-ended questions about what they like most about their jobs, what they dislike and under what events or circumstances they might leave.
招聘网站Indeed全球人才吸引部副主席斯科特·博诺说：“雇主们，尤其是特定行业的雇主，发现人们的离职速度加快了。” ||| Scott Bonneau, the vice president of global talent attraction at Indeed.com, said: “Employers, particularly in certain sectors, are seeing people leave at a faster rate."
有时候员工跳槽是为了追求更高的薪酬，但是招聘人员指出了另一个重要因素，那就是现在求职者对于得到老板重视和支持的期待更高了。 ||| Sometimes workers switch jobs in pursuit of higher salaries, but recruiters say a significant factor is the higher expectations of job candidates today when it comes to feeling seen and supported by their bosses.
技术行业招聘公司Dave Partners的首席执行官戴夫·卡瓦哈尔说：“人们离开的不是公司，而是主管。” ||| “People don’t leave companies, people leave managers,” said Dave Carvajal, the CEO of Dave Partners, a tech industry recruiting firm.
其他离职原因包括想获得更多弹性工作时间、希望远程工作或谋求职业发展机会。 ||| Other departures are spurred by chances to have more flexible hours, remote work or professional development opportunities.
尽管专家表示，劝留面谈是留住优秀员工的有效工具，但要郑重警告的是，面谈中听到的反馈意见，老板必须跟踪落实。 ||| While experts say stay interviews can be a valuable tool to retain top employees, there is one big caveat, Bosses have to actually follow through on the feedback they solicit.
最近刚入职NFT初创企业担任金融部主管的托马斯·吴表示：“你可以做出最美好的承诺，但如果到头来你无法履行和兑现，人们还是会离职。” ||| "At the end of the day, you can promise the best things in the world, but if you can’t execute and deliver, people will tend to look elsewhere,” said Thomas Wu, who recently took a job as the director of finance at an NFT startup.
卡瓦哈尔说，那些薪酬和福利竞争不过大企业的小公司人才流失风险更高，因此小公司往往会更频繁地开展劝留面谈。 ||| Carvajal said small businesses, which struggle to compete with huge companies in salaries and benefits, have more at stake and tend to use processes like stay interviews more frequently.
不过，博诺补充道，那些想继续跟着现任雇主干的员工如果被邀请参加劝留面谈，应该坦诚地说出自己的看法。 ||| Bonneau added, however, that workers who want to stay with their current employers should be honest about their perspectives if they are asked to participate in stay interviews.
他说：“如果你有什么想说的，或者你希望有所改变的，只要你的雇主是真心诚意想为员工排忧解难，这就是你坦诚相告的机会。” ||| "If there are things you’ve wanted to get off your chest or things you would really like to see changed, if your employer is going to the trouble of doing this in good faith, this is your opportunity to say those things,” he said.
