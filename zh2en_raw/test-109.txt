美国艾奥瓦州参议员查克·格拉斯利称，他从一名举报人那里获得了内部资料。该举报人声称665名联邦调查局（FBI）雇员为逃避纪律处分，而在接受行为不端调查后退休或辞职。 ||| Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said he obtained internal records from a whistleblower alleging 665 FBI employees retired or resigned following misconduct investigations to avoid receiving final disciplinary letters.
格拉斯利称，这名匿名举报人提供了一份司法部内部报告，该报告显示了在2004年至2020年间FBI雇员的离职记录，其中包括45名高级官员。 ||| Grassley said the whistleblower — whom he did not name — provided an internal Justice Department report that indicated the employees left between 2004 and 2020 and included 45 senior-level employees.
格拉斯利致信FBI局长克里斯托弗·雷和司法部长梅里克·加兰称：“这些指控和记录揭露了多年来在FBI内部女性员工不得不忍受的性侵行为。” ||| “The allegations and records paint a disgraceful picture of abuse that women within the FBI have had to live with for many years,” Grassley wrote in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland.
格拉斯利称：“这些性侵和不当行为令人发指、不可接受。” ||| “This abuse and misconduct is outrageous and beyond unacceptable,” Grassley continued.
格拉斯利办公室称，美联社2020年发布的一篇报道披露了FBI高官受到的不端性行为指控，此后司法部官员编写了这份报告。 ||| Grassley’s office said Justice Department officials created the report following an Associated Press story in 2020 that revealed sexual conduct allegations among senior officials in the bureau.
这份所谓的报告显示，665名FBI雇员在受到“行为不端指控”后离职，报告中并未说明这些指控与不端性行为有关，但报告标题中已经说明。 ||| The alleged report states the 665 employees left following “alleged misconduct,” but it did not specify it as sexual misconduct, although the document is titled as such.
格拉斯利办公室认为，实际人数可能比这更多，因为这份报告显示的数据并未包含行为不端调查开展期间和之前的离职雇员。 ||| His office suggested the actual figure could be larger, because the data doesn’t include departures that occurred during or just prior to the start of misconduct investigations.
美联社的调查报道催生了司法部的报告。该调查发现，FBI选择给那些面临指控的员工调岗或批准他们退休。 ||| The Associated Press investigation that apparently spawned the report’s creation found that the bureau opted to transfer those facing accusations or allow them to retire.
这样做是因为受到指控的员工在接受调查时仍然可以领取退休金和福利，并在调查流程结束后保持匿名。 ||| Doing so allows those employees to keep their pensions and benefits as officials investigate the allegations and maintain anonymity after the process concludes.
格拉斯利还称，举报人向他提供了另一份材料，其中分析了FBI局长雷对不端性行为零容忍政策的执行情况，详细说明了存在的“不一致裁决”。 ||| Grassley also said he received a second document from the whistleblower that analyzes Wray’s implementation of a zero-tolerance policy on sexual misconduct, detailing “inconsistent adjudication.”
据称，该文件称：“最近的不端性行为案件似乎表明，（职业责任办公室）在执行这一政策时似乎存在处罚随意、区别对待的问题，这可能会损害FBI纪律制度的一致性、公平性和正当程序。” ||| “Recent sexual misconduct cases appear to show [the Office of Professional Responsibility]’s application of this directive has resulted in seemingly random penalties and disparate treatment, potentially compromising the consistency, fairness and due process of the FBI’s disciplinary system,” the document allegedly states.
报告认为，在不端性行为案件中对非监管人员的处罚更重，而对监管人员的处罚更宽松。 ||| The report suggests nonsupervisors face greater penalties in sexual misconduct cases, while supervisors receive more lenient punishments.
格拉斯利在信中写道：“国会有义务对司法部和联邦调查局的失职进行客观独立的审查，并确定文件中所涉数据的准确性，以便国民知晓并理解为解决这些重大问题所做的任何改变。” ||| “Congress has an obligation to perform an objective and independent review of the Justice Department’s and FBI’s failures and determine the accuracy of the data contained in the documents so that the American people know and understand what, if any, changes have been made to solve these significant problems,” Grassley wrote in his letter.
美国联邦调查局在一份声明中表示，FBI不会包庇实施性骚扰的员工，并公布了全天候热线等新措施。他们还表示正在与立法者合作解决这一问题。 ||| The FBI in a statement said employees who commit sexual harassment have no place in the bureau, pointing to new resources such as a 24/7 hotline and saying it is working with lawmakers on the issue.
FBI表示：“我们不能合法阻止某人辞职或退休。令人气愤的是，当员工在案件裁决前离开时，我们几乎没有可以使用的手段。当接受调查的员工离职时，FBI会采取有效措施，确保个人档案反映出他们离职时正在接受调查，这样做可能会取消前执法部门人员享有的某些特权等。” ||| “The FBI cannot legally stop someone from resigning or retiring,” the agency said. “It is infuriating that we are left with little disciplinary recourse when people leave before their case is adjudicated. Under circumstances where an employee leaves under inquiry, the FBI takes available steps to ensure that the individual’s file reflects that they left under inquiry, which may lead to disqualification from certain privileges otherwise available to former law enforcement, among other things.”
《国会山》报已就该问题寻求司法部发言人的看法。 ||| The Hill has reached out to a Justice Department spokesperson for further comment.
