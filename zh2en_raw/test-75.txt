7月份，外来农业户籍人口失业率为5.1%，比上月回落0.2个百分点。 ||| For rural migrant workers, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.1 percent in July, down by 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.
付凌晖指出，外来农业户籍人口失业率继续低于整体失业率水平，这一方面是因为针对农民工群体的就业帮扶政策持续发力，另一方面要归功于4月份疫情暴发以来经济的快速恢复。 ||| Fu said the continuing downward trend can be attributed to measures targeted at helping migrant workers find jobs and quick recovery of the economy following COVID-19 outbreaks in April.

疫情影响了企业吸纳就业的能力，吸收大量青年人的服务业吸纳就业能力尤其受疫情影响。 ||| Enterprises, especially those in the service sector that cater to many young people, were hit by domestic outbreaks, and thus encountered difficulties and were unable to provide more job positions.
他还指出，青年人求职时倾向于进入较稳定岗位，现实与预期相差较大，进一步提高了失业率。 ||| He added that the preference among young job seekers for stable positions has also created a chasm between expectations and reality, further impacting the unemployment rate.
劳动力市场面临的压力仍然很大，我们下阶段将会继续贯彻落实多项措施来稳就业。 ||| The pressure on the labor market is still great, and we will continue to implement a variety of measures to stabilize employment.
