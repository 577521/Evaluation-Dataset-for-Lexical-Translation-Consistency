近日印度一名医学生在毕业考试中作弊被抓，他将蓝牙设备植入耳内以避免被发现。 ||| A medical student in India was recently caught cheating on his graduation exam with a Bluetooth device embedded in his inner ear to avoid detection.
2月21日，印度圣雄甘地医学院的78名医学生参加了临床医学学士期末考试。 ||| On February 21, 78 medical students took part in the final MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) exam at the Mahatma Gandhi Medical College in India.
然而，相比其他人，有位考生更迫切希望通过考试。 ||| One of them, however, was more desperate to pass than the rest.
这名医学生11年前就被录取了，但在过去几年里多次未能通过期末考试，这是他最后一次机会。 ||| Apparently, the unnamed medical student had been admitted 11 years ago, but had failed the final exam multiple times over the last few years, and this was his final chance to pass.
这名男子通过外科手术将蓝牙设备植入耳内，试图依靠作弊通过考试。 ||| To increase his chances, the man apparently turned to cheating, getting a Bluetooth device surgically implanted in his ear.
在考试前的一次突击检查中，监考人员对该学生进行了搜身，发现他裤子里的口袋里藏着一部手机，手机与蓝牙设备相连。 ||| He was rumbled during a surprise check before the exam when invigilators frisked him and found a phone hidden in the inside pocket of his trousers connected to the Bluetooth device.
监考官搜索了蓝牙附件，但一直未找到。直到该学生在接受询问时承认，他曾收买耳鼻喉外科医生给他植入这种肤色的设备。 ||| Officials searched for the Bluetooth attachment but could not find it until the student admitted under questioning that he had paid an ear, nose and throat surgeon to implant the skin-coloured device.
作弊在印度竞争激烈的医学院考试中十分普遍，近年来，印度政府一直在努力阻止学生使用越来越复杂的作弊方法通过考试。 ||| Cheating is rife in India's highly competitive medical school exams and authorities have in recent years struggled to stop pupils using ever-more sophisticated methods of cheating to pass.
曾经也有印度学生因作弊手段登上国际新闻头条，但这则新闻还是过于荒谬，令人难以置信。 ||| Indian students have made international news headlines for their cheating methods before, but this latest story definitely takes the cake, so much so that it’s hard to believe.
将蓝牙设备嵌入皮肤下听起来既痛苦又不现实，因为植入物必须包括电池和密封外壳。 ||| Having a Bluetooth device embedded under the skin sounds both painful and impractical, as the implant would have had to include both a battery and a sealed enclosure.
正如Hackday博客的用户所推测，这个设备很可能不是蓝牙接收器，而是一种附在骨骼上的骨传导助听器，通过骨骼振动将产生的声音传递给内耳的受体。 ||| As the folks at Hackaday suggest, it was likely not a Bluetooth receiver, but a bone conduction hearing aid attached to a bone that vibrates and transmits the resulting sound to the receptors of the inner ear via the bone itself.
然而，印度臭名昭著的“维亚帕姆丑闻”（一场大规模的入学考试舞弊案）的揭发者阿南德·雷博士声称，蓝牙设备植入很容易，早在2013年就在印度使用。 ||| However, Dr Anand Rai, a whistleblower in India’s notorious Vyapam scam – a massive entrance exam rigging operation – claimed that Bluetooth device implantation was easy to do and had been used in India as far back as 2013.
雷博士称：“将蓝牙安装在耳朵上非常容易。蓝牙暂时固定在耳朵上，可以移除。八年前，一名维亚帕姆丑闻作弊者也曾使用这种技术在医学考试中作弊。” ||| “It is very easy to get Bluetooth fitted in the ears. It is attached to the ear temporarily and can be removed. Such a technique was used by a Vyapam scam accused too to clear his medical exam eight years ago,” Dr. Rai said.
