新报告称，去年的股市繁荣和加密货币升值在美国新创造出100多万个百万富翁。 ||| The roaring stock market and crypto gains created more than a million new millionaires in the US last year, according to a new report.
财富调研公司斯佩特兰集团的报告指出，2021年，可投资资产超百万美元的美国人数量从2020年的1330万人飙升至创纪录的1460万人。 ||| The number of Americans with $1 million or more in investible assets surged to a record 14.6 million in 2021, up from 13.3 million in 2020, according to a report from wealth research firm the Spectrem Group.
超10%的百万富翁增长率是近年来最高的，这得益于股市、加密货币和其他资产创造的数万亿美元财富。 ||| The growth rate of over 10% was the strongest in years, boosted by trillions of dollars in wealth created by the stock market, crypto and other assets.
斯佩特兰集团的主席乔治·瓦尔波说：“这是各领域百万富翁最高产的一年。 ||| "It was the strongest year ever for millionaire creation in all segments,” said George Walper, president of Spectrem Group.
顶级富豪的增长是最迅猛的。 ||| The wealth surge was strongest at the top.
身家超2500万美元的美国人数量暴增了18%。 ||| The number of Americans worth $25 million or more surged by 18%.
身家超2500万美元的美国人数量从2020年的21.4万人达到了现在破纪录的25.2万人。 ||| There are now a record 252,000 Americans worth $25 million or more, up from 214,000 in 2020.
相比之下，财富在10万美元到100万美元之间的所谓的“大众富豪”投资者数量只增长了约2%。 ||| By contrast, the number of so-called “mass affluent” investors — or those with between $100,000 and $1 million — grew by about 2%.
美联储的数据显示，迄今为止股市是2021年百万富翁和其他富豪财富增长的最大驱动力。 ||| The stock market was by far the largest engine of wealth creation for millionaires and the wealthy in 2021.
标准普尔500指数去年增长了27%，而纳斯达克指数增长了21%。 ||| The S&P 500 gained 27% last year, while the Nasdaq was up 21%.
2021年最富有的1%美国人的股市财富增长了超3万亿美元。 ||| The wealthiest 1% of Americans gained over $3 trillion in stock-market wealth in 2021, according to Federal Reserve data.
加密货币和其他资产也增值了，包括非同质化代币、收藏品和房地产，这让富人的财富进一步增加。 ||| Crypto and other assets — such as NFTs, collectibles and real estate — also gained in value, adding to the wealth of the wealthy.
CoinGecko的数据显示，尽管价格波动很大，但去年加密资产的总市值增加了1.5万亿美元，达到了逾2.3万亿美元。 ||| The total market cap of crypto assets, despite wild swings in prices, gained $1.5 trillion last year to over $2.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko.
私募股权和风险资本的投资也大幅升值。 ||| Values of private-equity and venture-capital investments also surged.
因为富人有更多钱可用于投资，尤其是那些高风险高回报的投资，所以2021年超级富豪的投资收益也比大众富豪更多。 ||| Since the wealthy can afford to put more of their money in investments, especially those with the highest risks and rewards, ultra-millionaires benefitted more than the mass affluent in 2021.
瓦尔波说：“富人可以广泛涉猎各种投资。 ||| "The wealthy have the greatest exposure to the broadest investments,” Walper said.
去年不只是传统的流动性市场表现出色，另类投资、房地产投资和加密货币的收益也不错。” ||| “It wasn’t just traditional liquid markets that did well last year. It was also alternative investments, real-estate investments and crypto.”
顶级富豪财富的增长也扩大了美国的贫富差距。 ||| The wealth gains at the top also widened the wealth gap in the US.
美联储的数据显示，最富有的1%美国人拥有的财富在去年增长至创纪录的32%。 ||| The share of wealth held by the top 1% grew to a record 32% last year, according to the Fed.
财富专家指出，考虑到通胀率暴涨、利率上升和可能发生的经济衰退，2022年或将无法保持去年的财富涨幅。 ||| Wealth experts say it’s unlikely that last year’s gains will be sustained in 2022, given soaring inflation, rising interest rates and a potential economic slowdown.
今年以来股市下跌已经开始令投资者的利益受损。 ||| Stock market declines have already started trimming the paper fortunes of investors.
迄今为止纳斯达克指数已下跌了14.5%，标准普尔指数下跌了8.4%。 ||| The Nasdaq is down 14.5% for the year, while the S&P is down 8.4%.
瓦尔波说：“每一天都在变化，所以难以预测今年的财富走向如何。 ||| "Every day changes, so it’s hard to predict where the year will wind up,” Walper said.
但是2022年开局的前几个月已经描绘出与2021年不同的图景。” ||| “But the first few months of 2022 have already painted a different picture than 2021.”
