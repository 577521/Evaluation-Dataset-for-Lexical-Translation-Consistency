俄亥俄州立大学皮肤病学临床副教授苏珊·马西克博士称，她发现脱发患者，尤其是年轻男性特别注重预防脱发。 ||| Dr. Susan Massick, a clinical associate professor of dermatology at the Ohio State University, said she frequently saw patients for hair loss and young men were especially concerned about prevention.
她表示，尽可能多地留住头发的关键是早发现早预防。 ||| The most important thing to keep as much hair as possible, she said, is to catch hair loss early.
马西克告诉内幕网，她建议通过平衡饮食和局部使用米诺地尔两种方法治疗脱发和男性秃头。 ||| Massick told Insider a balanced diet and topical minoxidil were two methods she'd recommend to patients to help treat hair loss and male-pattern baldness.
马西克称，脱发的原因可能是压力和一种称为斑秃的自身免疫性疾病，但她的大多数患者都患有男性秃头，也称雄激素性脱发。 ||| Massick said that while hair loss could come from stress and an autoimmune disease called alopecia areata, the majority of her patients had androgenic alopecia, or male-pattern baldness.
据克利夫兰医学中心估计，25%的男性在21岁之前会出现脱发，70%的男性会随着年龄增长而脱发。 ||| According to Cleveland Clinic, an estimated 25% of men will notice hair loss before age 21, and 70% will experience hair loss as they age.
马西克说，雄激素性脱发是由激素二氢睾酮引起的。二氢睾酮会导致毛囊收缩，头发变细，更容易脱落。 ||| Male-pattern baldness is caused by the hormone dihydrotestosterone, or DHT, Massick said, which shrinks hair follicles, causing hair to grow thinner and fall out more easily.
马西克说，富含蛋白质和铁的均衡饮食有助于保持头发健康强壮。 ||| A balanced diet rich in protein and iron can help keep your hair healthy and strong, Massick said.
鸡肉、鸡蛋、希腊酸奶和牛肉等食物含有大量蛋白质，这是构成毛囊的主要成分。 ||| Foods like chicken, eggs, greek yogurt, and beef contain high amounts of protein, which is most of what makes up hair follicles.
据健康线网站报道，蛋白质含有铁元素，铁可以促进身体为与毛发生长相关的细胞提供氧气。 ||| Protein also contains iron, which helps the body bring oxygen to cells associated with hair growth, according to Healthline.
西奈山伊坎医学院皮肤病学助理教授、皮肤病医生德布拉·贾利曼博士告诉内幕网，当身体摄入蛋白质不足时，蛋白质消耗用于维持身体的基本功能，而不包括头发生长。 ||| Dr. Debra Jaliman, a dermatologist who is an assistant professor at the Dermatology Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, previously told Insider that when the body doesn't get enough protein, the protein that is consumed is allocated toward essential body functions, which doesn't include hair growth.
马西克称，要尽可能让头发放松，烫发、接发和直发等美发造型都会给头发带来压力，使其更容易脱落。 ||| Massick said to avoid putting tension on your hair whenever possible; hair styles like perms, extensions, and hair straightening can put stress on your hair that can make it more likely to fall out.
马西克表示，生发洗发水通常不值得购买，因为产品在头发中停留的时间不够长，无法穿透毛囊。针对头皮屑和湿疹等可能导致脱发的疾病的洗发水可以有效治疗这些疾病，但对治疗脱发没什么效果。 ||| Massick says shampoos that advertise hair growth usually aren't worth your money because they don't stay in your hair long enough to penetrate to your follicles. She said shampoos meant to treat conditions like dandruff and eczema, which can cause hair loss, can be effective at treating those conditions but not hair loss itself.
马西克介绍，米诺地尔是一种已经证明有助于防止脱发的非处方药，在某些情况下可以让头发再生。 ||| Minoxidil is an over-the-counter medication that Massick said had been shown to help prevent hair loss and, in some cases, regain lost hair.
据健康线网站报道，目前尚不清楚米诺地尔的作用原理，但它可以扩大毛囊，增加身体的毛发生长期。 ||| While it's unclear exactly how minoxidil works, it's thought to enlarge hair follicles and increase the body's hair-growth phase, according to Healthline.
