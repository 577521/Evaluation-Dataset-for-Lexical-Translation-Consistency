三月份美国增加了近50万就业岗位，道琼斯工业平均指数涨幅创下6%的新高，美国家庭在疫情期间的超额储蓄总额累计达近2.5万亿美元（约合人民币15.9万亿元）。 ||| The US economy added nearly half a million jobs in March. The Dow Jones industrial average is within 6% of its record high. And US households accumulated roughly $2.5 trillion in excess savings throughout the pandemic.

亿万富翁投资人、美联储前官员甚至连投资银行都反复警告美国经济可能在2023年出现危机。 ||| Billionaire investors, former Federal Reserve officials, and now even investment banks have repeatedly warned that the economy may hit a wall in 2023.

美国前财政部长劳伦斯·萨默斯在近期发表在《华盛顿邮报》上的一篇专栏文章中强调，当前的经济状况无疑让人联想起美国历史上的几次衰退前的情形。 ||| Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers emphasized in a recent Washington Post op-ed that current economic conditions are undeniably reminiscent of previous pre-recession periods in US history.
萨默斯写道：“在过去75年间，每次通胀率超过4%，失业率降到5%以下，美国经济就会在两年内陷入衰退。” ||| "Over the past 75 years, every time inflation has exceeded 4% and unemployment has gone below 5%, the US economy has gone into a recession within two years,” Summers wrote.
如今，美国通胀率接近8%，失业率在三月份降至3.6%。 ||| Today, the US inflation rate is nearing 8%, and the unemployment rate fell to just 3.6% in March.

加拿大帝国商业银行的波泽盖奥称，通货膨胀往往也会导致财富缩水，尤其是在消费价格涨幅超过工资涨幅时。 ||| CIBC’s Pzegeo said that inflation can often lead to wealth destruction as well, especially when rising consumer prices outpace wage growth.
他说：“通货膨胀的作用就如同征税。假以时日，你的财富将会逐渐缩水，从而为经济衰退埋下了伏笔。” ||| "It acts as a tax. So give it a little bit of time in the economy, and it’ll eat away at your wealth and set the stage for a recession,” he said.
世界大型企业联合会最近预测的国内生产总值也引发了人们对经济衰退的担忧。 ||| Recent GDP forecasts from the Conference Board have also led to fears that a recession could be on the horizon.

眼下，随着美国防疫限制措施逐步取消，通胀率创下四十年来的新高，美联储面临着一个艰巨的任务：确保美国经济实现所谓的软着陆。 ||| Now, with pandemic restrictions fading and inflation moving to highs not seen in four decades, the Fed is faced with a difficult task: ensuring a so-called soft landing for the US economy.
美联储的目标是提高利率，终结量化宽松政策，从而在不引发经济衰退的情况下给经济降温并抑制通胀。 ||| The goal is to raise interest rates and end QE in order to cool economic growth and combat inflation—all without causing a recession.

伊坎说：“我真的不知道美联储要怎么实现软着陆。我认为一定会出现硬着陆。” ||| "I really don’t know if they can engineer a soft landing,” Icahn said. “I think there’s going to be a rough landing.”
这位亿万富翁现在认为美国经济将会在明年底前出现经济衰退“甚至更糟”，对此德意志银行的经济学家也表示认同。 ||| The billionaire now believes the US economy will see a recession “or even worse” by the end of next year, and Deutsche Bank’s economists agree.
以马修·卢泽蒂为首的德意志银行经济学家在近日的一份备忘录中写道：“我们不再认为美联储能够实现软着陆。我们预期更激进的货币紧缩政策将会使美国经济陷入衰退。” ||| "We no longer see the Fed achieving a soft landing. Instead, we anticipate that a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy will push the economy into a recession,” the bank’s economists, led by Matthew Luzzetti, wrote in a recent note.
