糖尿病可能增加新冠后遗症风险 ||| Diabetes may increase long COVID risk
对此前七项研究的最新分析表明，糖尿病可能增加新冠后遗症的风险。 ||| Diabetes may increase the risk of long COVID, new analyses of seven previous studies suggest.
研究人员回顾了对康复四周以上的新冠感染者进行跟踪调查的研究，以了解哪些人出现了脑雾、皮肤问题、抑郁和呼吸短促等持续的新冠后遗症。 ||| Researchers reviewed studies that tracked people for at least four weeks after COVID-19 recovery to see which individuals developed persistent symptoms associated with long COVID such as brain fog, skin conditions, depression, and shortness of breath.
6月5日，在美国糖尿病协会年度科学会议上发表的一份报告显示，在其中三项研究中，糖尿病患者出现新冠后遗症的可能性是非糖尿病患者的四倍。 ||| In three of the studies, people with diabetes were up to four times more likely to develop long COVID compared to people without diabetes, according to a presentation on Sunday at the annual Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association.
研究人员表示，糖尿病似乎是导致新冠后遗症的“一个重要风险因素”，但研究发现是初步的，因为几个研究使用了不同的方法、对新冠后遗症的定义和随访时间不同，一些研究对象是住院新冠患者，而另一些研究对象是轻症新冠患者。 ||| The researchers said diabetes appears to be "a potent risk factor" for long COVID but their findings are preliminary because the studies used different methods, definitions of long COVID, and follow-up times, and some looked at hospitalized patients while others focused on people with milder cases of COVID-19.
研究人员表示，“需要在多个群体和环境中进行更多高质量的研究，以确定糖尿病是否确实是新冠后遗症的风险因素”。 ||| "More high-quality studies across multiple populations and settings are needed to determine if diabetes is indeed a risk factor" for long COVID, the researchers said.
“同时，建议对感染过新冠的糖尿病患者进行详细监测……”。 ||| "In the meantime, careful monitoring of people with diabetes... may be advised" after COVID-19.
孕期感染新冠影响婴儿学习能力 ||| COVID-19 in pregnancy linked with babies' learning skills
研究人员发现，孕妇感染新冠，其婴儿在学习、专注力、记忆和培养社交技能方面出现大脑发育问题的风险可能高于平均水平。 ||| Babies born to mothers who had COVID-19 while pregnant may be at higher than average risk for problems with brain development involved in learning, focusing, remembering, and developing social skills, researchers have found.
他们的研究对象是2020年3月至9月在马萨诸塞州分娩的7772名婴儿，对这些婴儿进行追踪研究直到他们满一周岁。 ||| They studied 7,772 infants delivered in Massachusetts between March and September 2020, tracking the babies until age 12 months.
在此期间，222名新冠病毒检测呈阳性的孕妇所产婴儿中有14.4%被诊为神经发育障碍，而未感染新冠病毒的孕妇所产婴儿中只有8.7%。 ||| During that time, 14.4% of the babies born to the 222 women with a positive coronavirus test during pregnancy were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder, compared to 8.7% of babies whose mothers avoided the virus while pregnant.
研究人员6月9日在《美国医学会杂志网络开放》上发文称，在考虑了早产等其他神经发育风险因素后，女性孕期感染新冠病毒，其后代的神经发育障碍确诊风险高86%。 ||| After accounting for other neurodevelopmental risk factors, including preterm delivery, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was linked with an 86% higher risk of a neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis in offspring, the researchers reported on Thursday in JAMA Network Open.
当感染发生在妊娠晚期时，这种风险增加了一倍多。 ||| The risk was more than doubled when the infection occurred in the third trimester.
研究人员指出，这些研究时间很短，不能排除随着婴儿的成长，其他神经发育影响可能会变得明显。 ||| The researchers point out that their study was brief and cannot rule out the possibility that additional neurodevelopmental effects will become apparent as the children grow up.
另一方面，他们指出，需要进行更大规模和更严格的研究，以排除其他潜在原因，并证明新冠病毒是罪魁祸首。 ||| On the other hand, they note, larger and more rigorous studies are needed to rule out other potential causes and prove that the coronavirus is to blame.
